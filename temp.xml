 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">The motivation and inspiration for this book come directly from expe- ences with clients during the years that I practiced HIV-related law at the Legal Aid Society of San Diego, Inc. The issues discussed in this work reflect issues that arose on a recurring basis with clients participating in HIV research studies, with investigators calling for guidance on the legal implications of particular aspects of their proposed studies, and with research institutions and health care facilities struggling to make sense of legal maneuvers aimed at obtaining the records of their HIV-infected patients. It is impossible to thank each of these persons individually for their provocative questions and their insights. The discussion of ethical and legal issues relating to the design of clinical trials reflects questions raised during discussions with Donald J. Slymen, Ph.D. Don was one of the first researchers, in my realm of experience, to pay close attention to ethical concerns, and I am greatly appreciative of his contribution to both my professional growth and the development of various scenarios discussed in this text. The portions of this text dealing with confidentiality are the result of many hours of thoughtful discussion and analysis with Penn Lerblance, J.D., now deceased and still missed. Penn and I often participated together as presenters of in-service training programs for health prof- sionals. Penn addressed discrimination, and I focused on confidentiality.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Here, Erich H. Loewy expands on his earlier book Textbook of Medical Ethics (1989) offering healthcare workers and students a new perspective on ethical practice. Textbook of Healthcare Ethics focuses on the social conditions in which medical practice occurs and how ethical healthcare decisions involves nurses, social workers, psychologists, technicians, and patients as well as physicians. This thoroughly revised and expanded edition addresses historical and theoretical underpinnings and practical concerns. A series of case studies serve as a guideline for further discussion. The text examines provocative issues such as organ donation, care of the terminally ill, abortion, HIV-positive healthcare professionals, physician-assisted suicide, and experimentation with fetal tissue. This is an ideal book for all members of the healthcare team as well as students and residents in any discipline of medicine.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Although virology and immunology are now considered separate disciplines, history shows that these areas ofinvestigation always overlapped and one cannot really exist without the other. This trend has become particularly significant and fruitful in the past few years in the area of herpesvirus research. The genomes of the most important herpesviruses have been sequenced, a significant portion of their genes have been identified, and many secrets of regulation of gene expr- sion have been unraveled. Now this progress sets the stage for a true revolution in herpesvirus research: analysis of interactions between the host and the virus. Because herpesviruses can induce, suppress, and fool the immune system, the most productive herpesvirologists are also expert immunologists, and the current results ofthis interdisciplinary effort are truly remarkable. Because herpesviruses cause many important human diseases, the devel- ment of vaccines against these agents is a very significant goal. This effort is also very challenging because of the complexity of herpesviruses and the lack of sufficient information about immune responses. The remarkable ability of herpesviruses to escape immune responses is - other feature that brings immunology and virology together. Herpesviruses - code many proteins that interact with and down-regulate some key elements of the immune system. Thisproperty of herpesviruses represents amajor challenge in developing strategies against these viruses. On the positive side, these viral proteins also provide novel tools for analyzing specific immune reactions and molecular mechanisms.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Nearly, 50 years ago, Karl Pribram in a discussion section accompanying MacLean’s proposal of a limbic system, criticized the visceral or limbic brain concept as theoretically too vague and cumbersome. In a recent review of the limbic system, Swanson points to Brodal’s criticism that the discovery of connections of limbic structures with virtually all parts of the nervous system render the concept of the limbic system useless, and better abandoned. Additional dissatisfaction surrounding the limbic brain concept stems from the feeling that it is historically inert (an antiquated 19th century construct). In our current age of neural networks, and parallel distributed process it is of little value, merely an historical curio. So why then this int- duction to limbic brain anatomy? We offer several interrelated rationales behind our labors. Recapitulation in the Service of Education: Although concepts had evolved in the second half of this century which effectively overthrew the idea of relatively isolated hemispheric districts (i. e. striatal, cortical, and limbic), parsing the hemisphere into these three districts was an important preliminary step achieved by our forebears in their efforts to understand the large scale structure of the higher mammalian cerebral hemisphere. An examination of how the limbic brain concept came to be provides an opp- tunity to recapitulate the process of exploration, discovery, and und- standing as it relates to one of these principle hemispheric domains.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Familiarity with nitric oxide is essential to a modern understanding of pathophysiologic mechanisms of infectious disease. Recent research has established nitric oxide and related reactive nitrogen intermediates to be important molecular mediators of diverse physiologic processes such as control of vascular tone, regulation of the immune system, and microbial and tumor cell growth. This book contains chapters by the leading researchers in the field and examines the biology and biochemistry of nitric oxide and its role in a variety of specific infections ranging from sepsis, tuberculosis and malaria to viral myocarditis, influenza, and AIDS.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">With the coming of the new millennium we are witnessing a revolution in our understanding of cancer genetics. These are very exciting times. Today we have at our disposal the technology to diagnose abnormalities in our cancer genes and the means to correct the deficit and very soon we will have the complete sequence of the human genome. With the use of gene chip technology the way doctors will be able to assess patients will change completely. Today we can diagnose abnormalities in ten thousand genes and within a short period of time we will be able to screen through our genome and discover potential abnormalities in our proto-oncogenes, tumour suppressor genes, differentiating genes, apoptotic genes and pro-inflammatory genes. In this book various authors have highlighted specific genes that could be expressed, overexpressed, neutralised or h- nessed to achieve cancer control. The problem of transferring the therapeutic gene into the cancer cell has been partly addressed with major developments in the field of naked plasmid DNA, adenovirus, retrovirus and adeno-associated viruses. However, further improvements are yet to be made to achieve significant gene transfer. Gene expression, in particular specificity of gene transfer, is obviously an important issue and one which is highlighted in this book by the use of specific promoter.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">The discovery of the human T cell leukemia virus type I in the late 1970s heralded a new era in retrovirology. For the first time, it was demonstrated that a retrovirus could play a role in the development of a human disease, in this case adult T cell leukemia (ATL). Several years later, the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) epidemic began, and it was dem- strated that a retrovirus, originally designated the human T cell lymp- tropic virus type 3, was the causal agent of this syndrome. This virus, later named the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), has since been extensively studied in terms of its pathogenesis as well as its ability to elicit immune responses. In that time, a tremendous amount of information has been obtained about the virus. Although recent drug regimens have been useful in significantly lowering viral loads and perhaps maintaining an asymptomatic state among individuals infected with HIV-1, an established “cure” for AIDS eludes us. In addition, the effective drug therapies are very expensive, and are not available to infected people in the third world, where greater than 90% of new infections occur. Furthermore, the development of viral resistance against the drug therapies is an additional concern. Despite extensive study, no effective vaccine has been developed. One of the problems in developing an effective vaccine against HIV-1 is the ability of the virus, particularly in the immunogenic envelop glycoprotein, to undergo amino acid hypervariability.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">In the pharmaceutical industry, the incorporation of the disciplines of pharma- kinetics, pharmacodynamics, and drug metabolism (PK/PD/DM) into various drug development processes has been recognized to be extremely important for approp- ate compound selection and optimization. During discovery phases, the identifi- tion of the critical PK/PD/DM issues of new compounds plays an essential role in understanding their pharmacological profiles and structure-activity relationships. Owing to recent progress in analytical chemistry, a large number of compounds can be screened for their PK/PD/DM properties within a relatively short period of time. During development phases as well, the toxicology and clinical study designs and trials of a compound should be based on a thorough understanding of its PK/PD/DM properties. During my time as an industrial scientist, I realized that a reference work designed for practical industrial applications of PK/PD/DM could be a very valuable tool for researchers not only in the pharmacokinetics and drug metabolism departments, but also for other discovery and development groups in pharmaceutical companies. This book is designed specifically for industrial scientists, laboratory assistants, and managers who are involved in PK/PD/DM-related areas. It consists of thirteen chapters, each of which deals with a particular PK/PD/DM issue and its industrial applications. Chapters 3 and 12 in particular address recent topics on higher throughput in vivo exposure screening and the prediction of pharmacokinetics in humans, respectively. Chapter 8 covers essential information on drug metabolism for industrial scientists.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Genome research will certainly be one of the most important and exciting sci- tific disciplines of the 21st century. Deciphering the structure of the human genome, as well as that of several model organisms, is the key to our understanding how genes fu- tion in health and disease. With the combined development of innovativetools, resources, scientific know-how, and an overall functional genomic strategy, the origins of human and other organisms’geneticdiseases can be traced. Scientificresearch groups and dev- opmental departments of several major pharmaceutical and biotechnological companies are using new, innovative strategies to unravel how genes function, elucidating the gene protein product, understanding how genes interact with others-both in health and in the disease state. Presently, the impact of the applications of genome research on our society in medicine, agriculture and nutrition will be comparable only to that of communication technologies. In fact, computational methods, including networking, have been playing a substantial role even in genomics and proteomics from the beginning. We can observe, however, a fundamental change of the paradigm in life sciences these days: research focused until now mostly on the study of single processes related to a few genes or gene products, but due to technical developments of the last years we can now potentially identify and analyze all genes and gene products of an organism and clarify their role in the network of lifeprocesses.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Membrane fusion and targeting processes are tightly regulated and coordinated. Dozens of proteins, originating from both the cytoplasm and membranes are involved. The discovery of homologous proteins from yeast to neurons validates a unified view. Although much is known about the interfering proteins, the events occurring when two lipid bilayers actually fuse are less clear. It should be remembered that lipid bilayers behave like soap-bubbles fusing when meeting each other. In this respect interfering proteins should be considered as preventing undesirable and unnecessary fusion and eventually directing the biological membrane fusion process (when, where, how, and overcoming the activation energy). In this latest volume in the renowned Subcellular Biochemistry series, some aspects of fusion of biological membranes as well as related problems are presented. Although not complete, there is a lot of recent information including on virus-induced membrane fusion. The contributors of the chapters are all among the researchers who performed many of the pioneering studies in the field.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">This text examines the dominant ways of looking at patient/clinician relationships in healthcare. By challenging these dominant views the author can explore presuppositions that are defective. She further explains how they come to be so readily and uncritically held and reinforced; and, why their implications can have such a profound affect on how we think and act. Using the methodology of philosopher, John Dewey, the author proposes an alternative bio/psycho/social approach to understanding the patient/clinician relationship and for resolving increasingly common bioethical issues that arise in healthcare settings.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">In recent years increased scientific attention has been given to immediate defense mechanisms based on non-clonal recognition of microbial components. These mechanisms constitute the innate immunity arm of the body s defense. Identification of pathogens by these mechanisms involves primarily receptors recognizing sugar moieties of various microorganisms. Innate immunity based mechanisms are essential for the existence of multicellular organisms. They are evolutionarily conserved and designed to provide immediate protection against microbial pathogens to eradicate infection. Activation of innate immunity is crucial for transition to specific immunity and for its orientation, and to assist the specific immune response in the recognition of pathogens and their destruction. Innate immunity is regularly involved in the arrest of bacterial, mycotic, viral and parasitic infections, giving the specific immune response time to become effective. It becomes critically essential in immunocompromised patients who fail to mount specific immune responses due to congenital or acquired immunodeficiencies as a result of chemotherapy, dialysis, immunosuppressive drugs, or HIV infection. The Innate Immunity arsenal constitutes polymorphonuclear and mononuclear phagocytes, mast cells, the complement system, Natural Killer cells, antimicrobial peptides, and presumably a subset of T lymphocytes with TCRl receptors.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Proceedings of the European Cooperation in the Field of Scientific and Technical Research (COST 825) Symposium on Mammary Gland Biology, held September 16-18, 1999, in Tours, France. It is difficult to overstate the evolutionary and functional significance of mammary tissue in biology. Substantial progress has been made by researchers in various disciplines, particularly over the last fifteen years, towards realizing the potential of this tissue to yield powerful experimental models for morphogenesis and tissue development; for cellular differentiation; for the biosynthesis and secretion of proteins, lipids, small molecules and inorganic salts; and for the coordination and regulation of these processes. More recently, the possibility of exploiting the secretory epithelial cells of mammary tissue as `cell factories' has become a reality and the recombinant production by lactating animals of an increasing number of proteins, valuable both in the pharmaceutical and `nutraceutical' fields, is in progress or under development. Also in this sphere of agricultural production, genetic as well as nutritional technologies are under investigation and exploitation to optimize milk composition for various end-uses - for instance in food process and manufacture. The possibilities of deriving health benefit from the bioactive properties of some of the minor constituents of milk are emerging to counter the highly-publicized negative health impact of excessive consumption of saturated animal fats. In human nutrition and medicine, the mammary gland is both a source of nutrition to the neonate and a potential health threat to the adult female - breast cancer remains the major single cause of female mortality in most developed countries. This volume provides a unique glimpse into our understanding, at the cutting edge of a variety of disciplines, of this versatile and extraordinary tissue, at the birth of the twenty-first century.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Pneumonia (along with influenza) is the sixth leading cause of death in adults. About 4 million adults develop pneumonia each year in the US, resulting in 64 million days of restricted activity, 39 million days of bed confinement, and 10 million days of lost work. Yet the admission rates to hospital, length of stay, investigations, antimicrobial therapy and prevention strategies vary greatly from one geographic area to the next, and the scientific basis for many of our management strategies for pneumonia is weak to nonexistent. There are over 100 microbial agents that can cause pneumonia and many of these, especially Streptococcus pneumoniae, Group A streptococcus, and Staphylococcus aureus, are in a state of flux in terms of changing antimicrobial resistance. This book is designed to provide new information about pneumonia and identify critical research questions that will come to the fore as we enter the 21st century.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Mitochondria are organelles in each cell outside the nucleus and are the energy source of all cells. As such, they are crucial to the healthy functioning of cells. Recent research has shown that mitochondrial dysfunction underlies a broad spectrum of disease, from maternally inherited genetic disorders to metabolism defects, aging, stroke, and neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, and Lou Gehrig's disease. This book brings together top researchers whose work in examining the pathophysiologic processes will lead to new strategies for prevention and treatment.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Today we have more control over how we live and how we die than we ever had before. This fact has produced many ethical problems. While much about life is biologically determined, much else is determined by the social circumstances surrounding it. Unfortunately, little energy is spent dealing with the social and psychological factors within which the medical/biological factors are imbedded. In this volume the authors examine some of the medical social and psychological conditions which affect the way we die. Important topics covered include attitudes toward death; suicide, assisted suicide and euthanasia; hospice and pain management. This volume will be of interest to all who work with terminally ill patients.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">The International Ethical Guidelines for Biomedical Research Involving Human Subjects (CIOMS and WHO, 1993: 11) defines “research” as referring to a class of activities designed to develop or contribute to generalizable knowledge. Generalizable knowledge consists of theories, principles or relationships, or the accumulation of information on which they are based, that can be corroborated by accepted scientific techniques of observation and inference. The International Guidelines for the Ethical Review of Epidemiological Studies (CIOMS, 1991) recognizes that it may be difficult to distinguish between research and program evaluation. It offers the following guidance: “The defining attribute of research is that it is designed to produce new, generalizable knowledge, as distinct from knowledge pertaining only to a particular individual or programme” (CIOMS, 1991, Guideline 52,23). Health research includes both medical and behavioral studies that relate to health. Research can be conducted in conjunction with patient care (clinical research), or it can be conducted outside of the context of clinical care. Research may involve only observation, or it may require, instead or in combination, a physical, chemical, or psychological intervention. Research may generate new records or may rely on already-existing records.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">The human brain contains more than a billion neurons which interconnect to form networks that process, store, and recall sensory information. These neuronal activities are supported by a group of accessory brain cells coll- tively known as neuroglia. Surprisingly, glial cells are ten times more - merous than neurons, and occupy more than half the brain volume (Hydén, 1961). Although long considered a passive, albeit necessary, component of the nervous system, many interesting and unusual functional properties of glial cells are only now being brought to light. As a result, the status of these cellular elements is approaching parity with nerve cells as a subject for experimental study. The term glia (or glue) seems today to be a misnomer in view of the diverse functions attributed to glial cells. Experimental studies in the last three decades have clearly established that the behavior of glial cells is far from passive, and that they are at least as complex as neurons with regard to their membrane properties. In addition, glial cells are of importance in signal processing, cellular metabolism, nervous system development, and the pathophysiology of neurological diseases. The Müller cell of the ver- brate retina provides a splendid example of an accessory cell that exhibits features illustrating every aspect of the complex behavior now associated with glial cells.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">th This volume contains articles presented at the X International Symposium on Purines and Pyrimidines in Man, held on May 14 19, 2000 in Tel Aviv, Israel. The first symposium in this series took place in Tel Aviv in 1973. Since then, the symposium has been held every three years in different parts of the world, including Europe, USA and Japan. The participants, in this series of symposia, are characterised by a wide interest in the various aspects of purines and pyrimidines in man, which include biochemistry, genetics, pharmacology, physiology, clinics, etc. Presentations in the symposia include clarification of metabolic pathways, characterisation of enzyme structure and kinetics and discoveries of new inborn errors of metabolism and suggestions for new therapeutic approaches for these inborn errors. In addition, development of new purine and pyrimidine derivatives for the treatment of cancer and viral diseases, and many more subjects of mutual interest were brought to the fore. With the development of therapeutic means and of new research tools, we have witnessed changes in the areas of interest. The interest in gout and uric acid urolithiasis has lessened, whereas molecular aspects, the role of purine and pyrimidine substances in neurotransmission and in purinergic signaling appear to gain greater interest. The articles, included in this volume, contain new data pertaining to the various aspects detailed above.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Central nervous system (CNS) infections continue to pose a serious problem in health care even with improved knowledge and treatment. Despite the introduction of newer antimicrobial agents and diagnostic techniques, the morbidity and mortality associated with CNS infections remain high. The morbidity associated with CNS infections may be even more important than the death rate especially in developing countries as neurological sequelae may deprive the survivors of intellect and physical ability, demeaning the quality of life and burdening health resources and social services. MR imaging is an important integral part of the protocol for the management of CNS infections and MR spectroscopy is increasingly being utilized in its management. This work is an attempt to provide a comprehensive review of imaging and spectroscopy of the commonly encountered CNS infections in the clinical practice in developing and developed countries. The first chapter deals with basic physical principles of MR imaging and spectroscopy that will help beginners to understand the technical terms used in subsequent chapters. The remaining 10 chapters deal with clinical, pathological, MR imaging and spectroscopy features and their applications in CNS infections. This will help in giving a comprehensive understanding to readers with a background in clinical, radiological, basic MRI, and neurological sciences. The T2 hypointense lesions are a real diagnostic dilemma especially in developing countries for which an algorithm has been suggested in the concluding chapter.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">This volume is the result of a conference sponsored by the Medical Alumni Association of the University of California, Davis and held in Sacramento, California, in January, 2000, The purpose of this conference was to examine the impact ofvarious health care structures on the ability of health care professionals to practice in an ethically acceptable manner. One of the ground assumptions made is that ethical practice in medicine and its related fields is difficult in a setting that pays only lip service to ethical principles. The limits of ethical possibility are created by the system within which health care professionals must practice. When, for example, ethical practice necessitates—as it generally does—that health care professionals spend sufficient time to come to know and understand their patients’ goals and values but the system mandates that only a short time be spent with each patient, ethical practice is made virtually impossible. One of our chief frustrations in teaching health care ethics at medical colleges is that we essentially teach students to do something they are most likely to find impossible to do: that is, get to know and appreciate their patients’ goals and values. There are other ways in which systems alter ethical possibilities. In a system in which patients have a different physician outside the hospital than they will inside, ethical problems have a different shape than if the treating physician is the same person.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Researchers seeking problems that offer more hope of success often avoid subjects that seem to be difficult to approach experimentally, or subjects for which experimental results are difficult to interpret. The breakdown part of protein turnover in vivo, particularly in nervous tissue, was such a subject in the past – it was difficult to measure and difficult to explore the mechanisms involved. For factors that influence protein metabolism, it was thought that protein content, function, and distribution are controlled only by the synthetic mechanisms that can supply the needed specificity and response to stimuli. The role of breakdown was thought to be only a general metabolic digestion, elimination of excess polypeptides. We now know that the role of breakdown is much more complex: it has multiple functions, it is coupled to turnover, and it can affect protein composition, function, and synthesis. In addition to eliminating abnormal proteins, breakdown has many modulatory functions: it serves to activate and inactivate enzymes, modulate membrane function, alter receptor channel properties, affect transcription and cell cycle, form active peptides, and much more. The hydrolysis of peptide bonds often involves multiple steps, many enzymes, and cycles (such as ubiquination), and often requires the activity of enzyme complexes. Their activation, modification, and inactivation can thus play an important role in biological functions, with numerous families of proteases participating. The specific role of each remains to be elucidated.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Staphylococcus aureus is now acknowledged as being the most important bacterial pathogen of humans. It usually produces localized disease but can be rapidly invasive, spreading through the tissues, invading bone, and seeding the bloodstream to produce a fulminant picture of septic shock, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and rapid death. Moreover, most strains of staph infections are becoming resistant to most antibiotics, thus posing a significant problem for hospitals and health care facilities. This book, a volume in the Infectious Agents and Pathogenesis series, presents chapters by the major researchers in the field.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">The pervasive influence of law on medical practice and clinical bioethics is often noted with a combination of exasperation and lamentation. Physicians and non-physician bioethicists, generally speaking, consider the willingness of courts, legislatures, and regulatory agencies to insinuate themselves into clinical practice and medical research to be a distinctly negative aspect of contemporary American society. They are quick to point out that their colleagues in other Western developed nations are not similarly afflicted, and that the situation which obtains elsewhere is highly preferable to the legalization and purported over-regulation of medicine that has taken place in the United States during the last fifty years. In this book I offer a decidedly different perspective. It is, admittedly, not entirely without personal and professional bias. Prior to becoming a fu- time academic, teaching bioethics in the setting of an academic medical center, I was, for nearly 20 years, an attorney specializing in health law. Even after earning a doctorate in philosophy, I was frequently considered to be the “resident lawyer” on the bioethics faculty, much more frequently looked to for my insights on the law than my perspective as one who had formally studied moral philosophy and applied ethics. I note this not out ofa sense of frustration or disappointment, but as confirmation that even among physicians and n- physician bioethicists, there is widespread recognition that the law does have important contributions to make in assessing the practice ofmedicine and the conduct of medical research.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">The ongoing debate on the use of DNA profiles to identify perpetrators in criminal investigations or fathers in paternity disputes has too often been conducted with no regard to sound statistical, genetic or legal reasoning. The contributors to Human Identification: The Use of DNA Markers all have considerable experience in forensic science, statistical genetics or jurimetrics, and many of them have had to explain the scientific issues involved in using DNA profiles to judges and juries. Although the authors hold differing views on some of the issues, they have all produced accounts which pay due attention to the, sometimes troubling, issues of independence of components of the profiles and of population substructures. The book presents the considerable evolution of ideas that has occurred since the 1992 Report of the National Research Council of the U.S. Audience: Indispensable to forensic scientists, laying out the concepts to all those with an interest in the use of genetic information. The chapters and exhaustive bibliography are vital information for all lawyers who must prosecute or defend DNA cases, and to judges trying such cases.</dcvalue>

In fact, one of our major challenges is to separate this signal, the 'real' biology or chemistry, from the noise. The tools developed to do this are called, collectively, biostatistics. Any tool, even a hammer, can be misused. This could result, at best, in inefficiency, and, at worst, in disaster. With the advent of newer, us- friendly statistical software packages, desk top computing, and point-a- click technologies, it is easier than ever to make mistakes in your analyses. The beauty of having access to so much computing power is that you can now enjoy ultimate flexibility in data processing: that can also be a problem. Ask your computer to produce a particular analysis, report or graphic, and that is exactly what you will get: if you happen to have asked for the wrong thing it will be produced just as quickly, and you will probably never know it was wrong. One aim of this handbook is to help you choose the correct tool for the job at hand, understand its strengths and weaknesses, and to help you recognize when you should seek expert advice. We describe biostatistics as a collection of tools for very good reasons.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Cyanobacteria make a major contribution to world photosynthesis and nitrogen fixation, but are also notorious for causing nuisances such as dense and often toxic `blooms' in lakes and the ocean. The Ecology of Cyanobacteria: Their Diversity in Time and Space is the first book to focus solely on ecological aspects of these organisms. Its twenty-two chapters are written by some thirty authors, who are leading experts in their particular subject. The book begins with an overview of the cyanobacteria - or blue-green algae, for those who are not specialists - then looks at their diversity in the geological record and goes on to describe their ecology in present environments where they play important roles. Why is one of the key groups of organisms in the Precambrian still one of the most important groups of phototrophs today? The importance of ecological information for rational management and exploitation of these organisms for commercial and other practical purposes is also assessed. Accounts are provided of nuisances as well as the ecology of the commercially successful Spirulina and the role of cyanobacteria in ecosystem recovery from oil pollution. Many chapters include aspects of physiology, biochemistry, geochemistry and molecular biology where these help general understanding of the subject. In addition there are three chapters dealing specifically with molecular ecology. Thirty-two pages of colour photos incorporate about seventy views and light micrographs. These features make the book valuable to a wide readership, including biologists, microbiologists, geologists, water managers and environmental consultants. The book complements the highly successful The Molecular Biology of Cyanobacteria already published by Kluwer.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Since its original appearance in 1977, Advanced Organic Chemistry has found wide use as a text providing broad coverage of the structure, reactivity and synthesis of organic compounds. The Fourth Edition provides updated material but continues the essential elements of the previous edition. The material in Part A is organized on the basis of fundamental structural topics such as structure, stereochemistry, conformation and aromaticity and basic mechanistic types, including nucleophilic substitution, addition reactions, carbonyl chemistry, aromatic substitution and free radical reactions. The material in Part B is organized on the basis of reaction type with emphasis on reactions of importance in laboratory synthesis. As in the earlier editions, the text contains extensive references to both the primary and review literature and provides examples of data and reactions that illustrate and document the generalizations. While the text assumes completion of an introductory course in organic chemistry, it reviews the fundamental concepts for each topic that is discussed. The Fourth Edition updates certain topics that have advanced rapidly in the decade since the Third Edition was published, including computational chemistry, structural manifestations of aromaticity, enantioselective reactions and lanthanide catalysis. The two parts stand alone, although there is considerable cross-referencing. Part A emphasizes quantitative and qualitative description of structural effects on reactivity and mechanism. Part B emphasizes the most general and useful synthetic reactions. The focus is on the core of organic chemistry, but the information provided forms the foundation for future study and research in medicinal and pharmaceutical chemistry, biological chemistry and physical properties of organic compounds. The New Revised 5th Edition will be available shortly. For details, click on the link in the right-hand column.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">The fourth Chinese Peptide Symposium, hosted by Peking University, was held at Chengdu, China on July 21 25, 1996 with 164 participants, including 45 scientists from abroad, representing 12 countries. The four day conference was both intense and spiritually rewarding. Our goal for CPS 96 was to provide a forum for the exchange of knowledge, cooperation and friendship between the international and Chinese scientific communities, and we believe this goal was met. The symposium consisted of 10 sessions with 55 oral and 78 poster presentations, including synthetic methods, molecular diversity and peptide libraries, structure and conformation of peptides and proteins, bioactive peptides, peptide immunology, De Novo design and synthesis of proteins and peptides, ligand receptor interactions, the chemistry biology interface and challenging problems in peptides. Theenthusiasticcooperationandexcellentcontributionsweregratifying andtheactive response of the invited speakers contributed to the success of the symposium. The presentations were of excellent caliber and represented the most current and significant aspects of peptide science. Dr. James P. Tam and Dr. Jie Cheng Xu were the recipients of ‘The Cathay Award’ sponsored by the H. H. Liu Education Foundation, offered for their seminal contributions in peptide science and the Chinese Peptide Symposium. Four outstanding young scientists were selected by the organizing committee to receive awards sponsored by Haikou Nanhai Pharmaceutical Industry Co. Ltd. (Zhong He Group).</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Animal cell technology is becoming an increasingly important part of biotechnology and many products are now used in human health care and for veterinary applications. However, there are many times more products actually in the developmental pipelines of the biotechnology industry, including various phases of clinical trials. The Proceedings of the 15th Meeting of the European Society for Animal Cell Technology (Tours, France, September 1997) presents the actual current state as well as New Developments and Applications in Animal Cell Technology for the benefit of society. These Proceedings represent both the current state and applications of animal cell technology and the way the technology is expanding into new areas to give a unique insight into new products and applications for human and animal health care.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Continuous cell lines derived from human cancers are the mostwidely used resource in laboratory-based cancer research. The first 3 volumes of this series on Human Cell Culture are devoted to these cancer cell lines. The chapters in these first 3 volumes have a common aim. Their purpose is to address 3 questions offundamental importance to the relevanceof human cancer cell lines as model systems of each type of cancer: 1. Do the cell lines available accurately represent the clinical presentation? 2. Do the cell lines accurately represent the histopathology of the original tumors? 3. Do the cell lines accurately represent the molecular genetics of this type of cancer? The cancer cell lines available are derived, in most cases, from the more aggressive and advanced cancers. There are few cell lines derived from low grade organ-confined cancers. This gap can be filled with conditionally immortalized human cancer cell lines. We do not know why the success rate for establishing cell lines is so low for some types of cancer and so high for others. The histopathology of the tumor of origin and the extent to which the derived cell line retains the differentiated features of that tumor are critical. The concept that a single cell line derived from a tumor at a particular site is representative oftumors at that site is naïve and misleading.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">The Fifteen American Peptide Symposium (15APS) was held in Nashville, Tennessee, on June 14-19, 1997. This biennial meeting was jointly sponsored by the American Peptide Society and Vanderbilt University. The attendance of 1,081 participants from 37 countries was lower than the two previously held Symposia. However, the number of participating countries was the largest. Thus, it was gratifying to see that this meeting retained both its international flavor and participant loyalty at a time when there are many more symposia held each year on similar subjects. The scientific program, thanks to the insights and efforts of the Program Committee as well as Dr. Peter Schiller, the President of the American Peptide Society, was extraordinarily rich, diverse, and exciting. It was comprised of 124 oral and 550 poster presentations. Three prominent format changes were installed. First, the Symposium started on Saturday instead of Sunday. Second, the program opened on Saturday afternoon with a Mini-symposium by the Young Investigators to give them an early start and attention. Finally, 40 short and definitive reports were given in two parallel sessions. The expanded format permitted an unprecedented number of lectures and enabled wider participation by the attending delegates.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">claim was that he had faced a conflict of duties pitting his legal duty not to kill against his duty as a physician to relieve his patient’s unbearable suffering. He was acquitted on the important grounds of conflict of duty. These grounds are based on a concept in Dutch law called "force majeure" 4 which recognizes extenuating circumstances such as conflicts of duty. The acquittal was upheld by the Lower Court of Alkmaar, but revoked by an Amsterdam court of appeal. The case went on to the Supreme Court, but before the Supreme Court's decision was issued, the Royal Dutch Medical Association (RDMA) attempted to clarify the criteria for euthanasia that many within the profession already accepted. The RDMA proposed that physicians be permitted to perform euthanasia provided that a set of procedures had been met. Variously stated, the guidelines contain the following central provisions: Voluntary, competent, explicit, and persistent requests on the part of the • patient; Requests based on full information; • The patient is in a situation of intolerable and hopeless suffering (either • physical or mental); No further acceptable alternatives to euthanasia. All alternatives • acceptable to the patient for relief of suffering having been tried; Consultation with at least one other physician whose judgment can be • 5 expected to be independent. Indirectly, these guidelines became the criteria prosecutors used to decide whether or not to bring charges.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">In the late 1980s, Peptide Societies were established in Europe, the United States, and Japan, and more recently, in the Asian and the Pacific Rim regions including Australia, China, and Korea. At the time of the establishment of the American, European and Japanese Peptide Societies, the International Liaison Organizing Committee representing these Peptide Societies, along with the Australian Peptide Society, began discussions for holding international confer ences which would supercede or be held in lieu of the numerous individual meetings, held by the peptide societies of each individual country or region. The representative of the Chinese Peptide Society participated in these discus sion in the International Liaison Organizing Committee at the meeting of the American Peptide Symposium in Nashville, in June 1997. After lengthy discus sions over several years, we agreed to organize and host the International Peptide Symposium in Japan. The First International Peptide Symposium (IPS’97) was held on November 30–December 5, 1997, in Kyoto, and was co sponsored by four Peptide Societies. The attendance at this Symposium was 550 participants, including representatives from 32 different countries. We were very pleased with this outcome and anticipate an even larger attendance for forthcoming Symposia in future years. The revolution and advances in science and technology during the past two decades has caused traditional peptide chemistry to expand to peptide science, spreading from physical science to biology, pharmacology, and medicine.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Animal cell technology is a growing discipline of cell biology which aims not only to understand structures, functions and behaviors of differentiated animal cells but also to ascertain their abilities to be used for industrial and medical purposes. The goal of animal cell technology includes accomplishments of clonal expansion of differentiated cells with useful ability, optimization of their culture conditions, modulation of their ability for production of medically and pharmaceutically important proteins, and the application of animal cells to gene therapy and artificial organs. This Volume gives the readers a complete review of the present state of the art in Japan. The Proceedings will be useful for cell biologists, biochemists, molecular biologists, immunologists, biochemical engineers and other disciplines related to animal cell culture, working either in academic environments or in industries of biotechnology and pharmacy.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Debate regarding organ sales is largely innocent of the history of thought on the matter. This volume seeks to remedy this shortcoming. Positions for or against a market in human organs are nested within moral intuitions, ontological or political theoretical premises, or understandings of special moral concerns, such as permissible uses of the body, which have a long history of analysis. The essays compass the views of Plato, Aristotle, Aquinas, Locke, Kant, Hegel, Mill and Christianity, as well as particular methodological approaches, such as the phenomenology of the body, natural law theory, legal theory and libertarian critique of legal theory. These discussions cluster a number of conceptually independent philosophical concerns: (1) What is the appropriate understanding of the relationship between persons and their bodies? (2) What does it mean to `own' an organ? (3) Do governments have moral authority to regulate how persons use their own body parts? (4) What are the costs and benefits of a market in human organs? Such questions are related by an urgent public health challenge: the considerable disparity between the number of patients who could significantly benefit from organ transplantation and the number of human organs available for transplantation. This volume explores the theoretical, normative, and historical foundations for alternative policies for procurement and transplantation of human organs.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">This volume explores Confucian views regarding the human body, health, virtue, suffering, suicide, euthanasia, `human drugs,' human experimentation, and justice in health care distribution. These views are rooted in Confucian metaphysical, cosmological, and moral convictions, which stand in contrast to modern Western liberal perspectives in a number of important ways. In the contemporary world, a wide variety of different moral traditions flourish; there is real moral diversity. Given this circumstance, difficult and even painful ethical conflicts often occur between the East and the West with regard to the issues of life, birth, reproduction, and death. The essays in this volume analyze the ways in which Confucian bioethics can clarify important moral concepts, provide arguments, and offer ethical guidance. The volume should be of interest to both general readers coming afresh to the study of bioethics, ethics, and Confucianism, as well as for philosophers, ethicists, and other scholars already familiar with the subject.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">It is a truism of science that the more fundamental the subject, the more universally applicable it is. Nevertheless, it is important to strike a level of “fundamentalness” appropriate to the task in hand. For -depth study of the mechanics of motor cars would tell one example, an in nothing about the dynamics of traffic. Traffic exists on a different “level” - it is dependent upon the existence of motor vehicles but the physics and mathematics of traffic can be adequately addressed by considering motor vehicles as mobile “blobs”,with no consideration of how they become mobile. To start a discourse on traffic with a consideration of the mechanics of motor vehicles would thus be inappropropriate. In writing this volume, I have wrestled with the question of the appropriate level at which to address the physics underlying many of the techniques used in protein isolation. I have tried to strike a level as would be used by a mechanic (with perhaps a slight leaning towards an engineer) - i.e. a practical level, offering appropriate insight but with minimal mathematics. Some people involved in biochemical research have a minimal grounding in chemistry and physics and so I have tried to keep it as simple as possible.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Animal cell technology is a growing discipline of cell biology which aims not only to understand structures, functions and behaviors of differentiated animal cells but also to ascertain their abilities to be used in industrial and medical purposes. The goal of animal cell technology includes accomplishments of clonal expansion of differentiated cells with useful ability, optimization of their culture conditions, modulation of their ability to produce medically and pharmaceutically, important proteins, and the application of animal cells to gene therapy and artificial organs. This volume gives the readers a complete review of present state of the art in Japan. The Proceedings will be useful for cell biologists, biochemists, molecular biologists, immunologists, biochemical engineers and other disciplines related to animal cell culture, working in either academic environments or in biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">The human body contains many specialized tissues that are capable of fulfilling an incredible variety of functions necessary for our survival. This volume in the Human Cell Culture Series focuses on mesenchymal tissues and cells. The in vitro study of mesenchymal cells is perhaps the oldest form of human cell culture, beginning with the culturing of fibroblasts. Fibroblasts have long been generically described in the literature, arising from many tissue types upon in vitro cell culture. However, recent studies, many enabled by new molecular biology techniques, have shown considerable diversity in fibroblast type and function, as described within this volume. Mesenchymal tissue types that are described within include bone, cartilage, tendons and ligaments, muscle, adipose tissue, and skin (dermis). The proper function of these tissues is predominantly dependent upon the proper proliferation, differentiation, and function of the mesenchymal cells which make up the tissue. Recent advancements in primary human mesenchymal cell culture have led to remarkable progress in the study of these tissues. Landmark experiments have now demonstrated a stem cell basis for many of these tissues, and, furthermore, significant plasticity and inter-conversion of stem cells between these tissues, resulting in a great deal of contemporary excitement and controversy. Newly-developed mesenchymal cell culture techniques have even lead to novel clinical practices for the treatment of disease.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">K. Danner Clouser is one of the most important figures in establishing and shaping the fields of medical ethics, bioethics, and the philosophy of education in the second half of the twentieth century. Clouser challenged many established approaches to moral theory and offered innovative strategies for integrating the humanities into professional education, especially that of physicians and nurses. The contributions published in Building Bioethics: Conversations with Clouser and Friends on Medical Ethics are unique both in their devotion to a critical review of his contributions, and in bringing together internationally known figures in bioethics, medical ethics, and philosophy of medicine to comment upon Clouser's work. These leaders of the field include Tom Beauchamp, Daniel Callahan, James Childress, Nancy Dubler, H. Tristram Engelhardt, Al Jonsen, Loretta Kopelman, Larry McCullough, John Moskop, and Robert Veatch. This book merits special attention from those interested in bioethics, philosophy of medicine, medical ethics, philosophy, medical education, religious studies, and nursing education.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Continuous cell lines derived from human cancers are the most widely used resource in laboratory-based cancer research. The first 3 volumes of this series on Human Cell Culture are devoted to these cancer cell lines. The chapters in these first 3 volumes have a common aim. Their purpose is to address 3 questions of fundamental importance to the relevance of human cancer cell lines as model systems of each type of cancer: 1. Do the cell lines available accurately represent the clinical presentation? 2. Do the cell lines accurately represent the histopathology of the original tumors? 3. Do the cell lines accurately represent the molecular genetics of this type of cancer? The cancer cell lines available are derived, in most cases, from the more aggressive and advanced cancers. There are few cell lines derived from low grade organ-confined cancers. This gap can be filled with conditionally immortalized human cancer cell lines. We do not know why the success rate for establishing cell lines is so low for some types of cancer and so high for others. The histopathology of the tumor of origin and the extent to which the derived cell line retains the differentiated features of that tumor are critical. The concept that a single cell line derived from a tumor at a particular site is representative of tumors at that site is naïve and misleading.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">High-throughput screening and combinatorial chemistry are two of the most potent weapons ever to have been used in the discovery of new drugs. At a stroke, it seems to be possible to synthesise more molecules in a month than have previously been made in the whole of the distinguished history of organic chemistry, Furthermore, all the molecules can be screened in the same short period. However, like any weapons of immense power, these techniques must be used with care, to achieve maximum impact. The costs of implementing and running high-throughput screening and combinatorial chemistry are high, as large dedicated facilities must be built and staffed. In addition, the sheer number of chemical leads generated may overwhelm the lead optimisation teams in a hail of friendly fire. Mother nature has not entirely surrendered, as the number of building blocks that could be used to build libraries would require more atoms than there are in the universe. In addition, the progress made by the Human Genome Project has uncovered many proteins with different functions but related binding sites, creating issues of selectivity. Advances in the new field of pharmacogenomics will produce more of these challenges. There is a real need to make hi- throughput screening and combinatorial chemistry into 'smart' weapons, so that their power is not dissipated. That is the challenge for modellers, computational chemists, cheminformaticians and IT experts. In this book, we have broken down this grand challenge into key tasks.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">The germs of the ideas in this book became implanted in me during my experience as a resident in clinical pathology at Boston University Medical Center. At the time, I had inklings that the test results churned out by our laboratories were more than scientific facts. As a philosophically unsophisticated young physician, however, I had no language or framework to analyze what I saw as a deep philosophical problem, a problem largely unrecognized by most physicians. The test results provided by our laboratories were accurate and of great practical importance for patient care. However, most of the physicians who relied on our test results to diagnose and treat their patients either did not have the time or interest to consider the philosophical issues inherent in diagnosis, or, like me, had inadequate means to further analyze them. It was more than ten years later that I began doctoral studies in philosophy, and I was fortunate to find a faculty that was supportive ofmy efforts to address the problem. This book began as my doctoral dissertation in the Department of Philosophy at Georgetown University. I would like to acknowledge the assistance of my mentor, Robert Veatch, Ph. D. Our conversations during my Georgetown years led me in new and often fascinating directions. I would also like to acknowledge the help of Kenneth Schaffner, M. D. , Ph. D.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">During the last 10 years, there has been a `revolution' in ecosystem modelling. The generality and predictive power of our models have increased in a way that was inconceivable 10 years ago. This book describes a new generation of practically useful models that predict as well as one can measure - if one measures well. And yet, they are driven by readily available driving variables and have a general structure that applies to most types of pollutants in aquatic systems. The major reason for this development is, in fact, the Chernobyl accident. Large quantities of radiocesium were released in April/May 1986 as a pulse. To follow the pulse of radiocesium through ecosystem pathways has meant that important fluxes and mechanisms, i.e., ecosystem structures, have been revealed. It is important to stress that many of these new structures and equations are valid not just for radiocesium, but for most types of contaminants, e.g. for metals, nutrients and organics. This means that the models, methods (of building and testing models) and equations described in this book for lakes and coastal areas should be of great interest also to other ecosystem modellers. This book will be of considerable interest to: students in radioecology, geosciences and biology; environmental engineers; consultants; administrators and scientists interested in the spread, biouptake and ecosystem effects of chemical pollutants in aquatic ecosystems.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">of UB’s medical school, that UB developed its School of Arts and Sciences, and thus, assumed its place among the other institutions of higher education. Had Fillmore lived throughout UB’s first seventy years, he would probably have been elated by the success of his university, and he should have been satisfied and pleased that UB remained intrinsically bonded to its community while at the same time engrafting the values and standards important to higher education’s mission in the region. UB and its medical school have undergone many challenging transitions since 1846. Included among them were: (1) the completion of an academic campus in the far northeast comer of the City of Buffalo while leaving its medical, dental and law schools firmly situated in the core of downtown Buffalo; (2) the eventual relocation, after the second world war, of the law school to the newer campus in Amherst, and the medical and dental school to the original academic campus: and (3) the merger with the State University of New York System in 1962. Despite these significant transitions, any one of which could have changed the intrinsic integrity of UB and disrupted the bonding between community and university, that did not happen. To this day, the ties between community and academe persist. Fillmore and White should celebrate their success and important contribution to Buffalo and Western New York.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">The Fifth Chinese Peptide Symposium, hosted by Lanzhou University, was held at Lanzhou, China July 14-17, 1998, with 156 participants, including 30 scientists from abroad, representing nine countries. The four-day conference was both intense and spiritually rewarding. Our goal for CPS-98 was to provide a forum for the exchange of knowledge, cooperation and friendship between the international and Chinese scientific communities, and we believe this goal was met. The symposium consisted of 8 sessions with 42 oral and 90 poster presentations, including synthetic methods, molecular diversity and peptide libraries, structure and conformation of peptides and proteins, bioactive peptides, peptide immunology, De Novo design and synthesis of proteins and peptides, ligand-receptor interactions, the chemistry-biology-interface and challenging problems in peptides. The enthusiastic cooperation and excellent contributions were gratifying and the active response of the invited speakers contributed to the success of the symposium. The presentations were of excellent caliber and represented the most current and significant aspects of peptide science. Dr. Kit Lam of the University of Arizona and Dr. Yun-Hua Ye of Peking University were the recipients of “The Cathay Award” sponsored by the H. H. Liu Education Foundation, offered for their seminal contribution in peptide science and the Chinese Peptide Symposium. Four outstanding young scientists were selected by the organizing committee to receive awards sponsored by Haikou Nanhai Pharmaceutical Industry Co. Ltd. (Zhong He Group).</dcvalue>

For labor and lactation oxytocin you must buy! Enkephalin always gives a good runner’s high! So won’t you try peptides? Small proteins, the best in the land!” The above words [1], penned by Gary Gisselman to open Peptide Ångst: La Triviata, the opera which made its world premiere on July 1, 1999, also serve as a fitting charge to the th 16 American Peptide Symposium. This latest edition of a premier biennial series was held under the auspices of the American Peptide Society, June 26–July 1, 1999, at the Minneapolis Convention Center, Minneapolis,Minnesota, with the undersigned serving as Co-Chairs. The fortunate coincidence of the calendar allowed us to set as the theme “Peptides for the New Millennium”, and in our judgment, the approximately 1200 participants [2] who converged in the Twin Cities from academic and industrial institutions in 36 countries were treated to an exciting and stimulating conference that left most everyone with an enthusiastic vision for the future of our field. The present Proceedings volume should serve as a handy reference source and succinct snapshot of peptide science at essentially its century mark – the clock having started with the initial contributions of Emil Fischer and Th.

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Beyond Brain Death offers a provocative challenge to one of the most widely accepted conclusions of contemporary bioethics: the position that brain death marks the death of the human person. Eleven chapters by physicians, philosophers, and theologians present the case against brain-based criteria for human death. Each author believes that this position calls into question the moral acceptability of the transplantation of unpaired vital organs from brain-dead patients who have continuing function of the circulatory system. One strength of the book is its international approach to the question: contributors are from the United States, the United Kingdom, Liechtenstein, and Japan. This book will appeal to a wide audience, including physicians and other health care professionals, philosophers, theologians, medical sociologists, and social workers.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">In the next couple of years the human genome will be fully sequenced. This will provide us with the sequence and overall function of all human genes as well as the complete genome for many micro-organisms. Subsequently it is hoped, by means of powerful bioinformatic tools, to determine the gene variants that contribute to various multifactorial diseases and genes that exist in certain infectious agents but not humans. As a consequence, this will allow us to define the most appropriate levels for drug intervention. It can be expected that the number of potential drug targets will increase, possibly by a factor of 10 or more. Nevertheless, sequencing the human genome or, for that matter, the genome of other species will only be the starting point for the understanding of their biological function. Structural genomics is a likely follow-up, combined with new techniques to validate the therapeutic relevance of such newly discovered targets. Accordingly, it can be expected that in the near future we will witness a substantial increase in novel putative targets for drugs. To address these new targets effectively, we require new approaches and innovative tools. At present, two alternative, yet complementary, techniques are employed: experimental high-throughput screening (HTS) of large compound libraries, increasingly provided by combinatorial chemistry, and computational methods for virtual screening and de novo design. As kind of status report on the maturity of virtual screening as a technique in drug design, the first workshop on new approaches in drug design and discovery was held in March 1999, at Schloß Rauischholzhausen, near Marburg in Germany. More than 80 scientists gathered and discussed their experience with the different techniques. The speakers were invited to summarize their contributions together with their impressions on the present applicability of their approach. Several of the speakers followed this request which is summarized in this publication.</dcvalue>

Professor Lesley J. Rogers, Chapter 1 of Side Bias: A Neuropsychological Perspective. This volume contains 14 chapters from a veritable `United Nations' of experts in the field of lateralization of function. They write comprehensive reviews, present data, and pose new questions concerning the evolutionary origins and development of side bias, methodological concerns with the way we measure handedness and footedness, and some more unusual aspects of human beings' lateralized behavior, such as asymmetrical cradling and pseudoneglect. The book will be essential reading for students of behavioral neuroscience and neuropsychology interested in lateralization of function as well as for established researchers in the field.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">The present book entitled “Novel Frontiers in the Production of Compounds for Biomedical Uses” can perhaps be placed in its best perspective by the Shakespearean character in The Tempest who exclaimed" What’s past is prologue”. Indeed, this compilation of some of the outstanding presentations in the field of biomedicine made at th the 9 European Congress on Biotechnology (Brussels, Belgium, July 11-15, 1999) not only reflects the achievements of the recent past, but provides a privileged glimpse of the biotechnology that is emerging in the first decade of the new Millennium. It is becoming increasingly apparent that biotechnology is offering biomedicine novel approaches and solutions to develop a sorely needed new generation of biopharmaceuticals. This is all the more necessary because in recent years, new diseases have emerged with extraordinary lethality in all corners of the globe, while age-related chronic illnesses have filled the gap wherever biomedicine has made successful inroads. The rise of antibiotic resistance also poses major threats to public health. Thus, as disease patterns evolve, the rational development of new drugs is becoming urgent, not only for the clinical outcome of patients, but also in optimising the allocation of scarce health care resources through the use of cost-effective productions methods. It is in response to all these challenges that biotechnology offers new strategies that go beyond the more traditional approaches. By the mid-1990’s, the number of recombinant products approved annually for therapeutic use reached double digits. With the advent of the genomics revolution.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">The daily production of hundreds of billions of blood cells through the process of hematopoiesis is a remarkable feat of human physiology. Transport of oxygen to tissues, blood clotting, antibody- and cellular-mediated immunity, bone remodeling, and a host of other functions in the body are dependent on a properly functioning hematopoietic system. As a consequence, many pathological conditions are attributable to blood cell abnormalities, and a fair number of these are now clinically treatable as a direct result of hematopoietic research. Proliferation of hematopoietic stem cells, and their differentiation into the many different lineages of functional mature cells, is highly regulated and responsive to many environmental and physiological challenges. Our relatively advanced understanding of this stem cell system provides potentially important insights into the regulation of development in other tissues, many of which are now being acknowledged as stem ce- based, perhaps even into adulthood. The recent public and scientific fanfare following announcement of human embryonic stem cell studies suggests that stem cell research will continue to be a relevant and exciting topic.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Animal biotechnology is a broad umbrella encompassing the polarities of fundamental and applied research including molecular modelling, molecular and quantitative genetics, gene manipulation, development of diagnostics and vaccines and manipulation of tissue or digestion metabolism by growth promoters. Although animal biotechnology in the broadest sense is not new, what is new is the level of complexity and precision involved in scientists' current ability to manipulate living organisms. This new book sets out to show that the important ideas in animal biotechnology are exciting and relevant to everyday experience. It represents an important update of the literature for research workers, lecturers, and advisers in animal science, but is also a core text for advanced undergraduate courses in animal science and biotechnology. It will be an essential acquisition for librarians in agriculture and veterinary science.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">This book illustrates the major trends in applied microbiology research with immediate or potential industrial applications. The papers proposed reflect the diversity of the application fields. New microbial developments have been done as well in the food and health sectors than in the environmental technology or in the fine chemical production. All the microbial genera are involved : yeast, fungi and bacteria. The development of biotechnology in parallel with the industrial microbiology has enabled the application of microbial diversity to our socio-economical world. The remarkable properties of microbes, inherent in their genetic and enzymatic material, allow a wide range of applications that can improve our every day life. Recent studies for elucidating the molecular basis of the physiological processes in micro-organisms are essential to improve and to control the metabolic pathways to overproduce metabolites or enzymes of industrial interest. The genetic engineering is of course one of the disciplines offering new horizons for the « fantastic microbial factory » . Studies of the culture parameter incidence on the physiology and the morphology are essential to control the response of the micro-organisms before its successful exploitation at the industrial scale. For this purpose, fundamental viewpoints are necessary. Development of novel approaches to characterise micro-organisms would also facilitate the understanding of the inherent metabolic diversity of the microbial world, in terms of adaptation to a wide range of biotopes and establishment of microbial consortia.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Early integration is the key to success in industrial biotechnology. This is as true when a selected wild-type organism is put to work as when an organism is engineered for a purpose. The present volume Engineering and Manufacturing for Biotechnology took advantage of the 9th European Congress on Biotechnology (Brussels, Belgium, July 11-15, 1999): in the topics handled and in the expertise of the contributors, the engineering science symposia of this congress offered just what was needed to cover the important topic of integration of process engineering and biological research. The editors have solicited a number of outstanding contributions to illustrate the intimate interaction between productive organisms and the numerous processing steps running from the initial inoculation to the packaged product. Upstream processing of the feed streams, selection of medium components, product harvesting, downstream processing, and product conditioning are just a few major steps. Each step imposes a number of important choices. Every choice is to be balanced against time to market, profitability, safety, and ecology.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">One ofthe major drivers in biological research is the establishment ofstructures and functions of the 50,000 or so proteins in our bodies. Each has a characteristic- dimensional structure, highly "ordered" yet "disordered"! This structure is essential for a protein's function and, significantly, it must be sustained in the competitive and complex environment of the living cell. It is now being recognised that when a cell loses control, proteins can se- assemble into more complex supermolecular structures such as the amyloid fibres and plaques associated with the pathogenesis of prion (CJD) or age-related (Alzheimer's) diseases. This is a pointer to the wider significance of the self-assembling properties of polypeptides. It has been long known that, in silk, polypeptides are assembled into- sheet structures which impart on the material its highly exploitable properties of flexibility combined with high tensile strength. But only now emerging is the recognition that peptides can Self-assemble into a wide variety of non-protein-like structures, including fibrils, fibres, tubules, sheets and monolayers. These are exciting observations and, more so, the potential for materials and medical exploitations is so wide ranging that over 80 scientists from Europe, USA, Japan and Israel. met 1-6 July 1999 in Crete, to discuss the wide-ranging implications of these novel developments. There was a spirit of excitement about the workshop indicative of an important new endeavor. The emerging perception is that of a new class of materials set to become commercially viable early in the 21st century.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">At the end of the 20th century, a tremendous progress was made in biotechnology in its widest sense. This progress was largely possible as a result of joint efforts of top academic researchers in both pure fundamental sciences and applied research. The surplus value of such interdisciplinary approaches was clearly highlighted during the 9th European Congress on Biotechnology that was held in Brussels, Belgium (11-15 July, 1999). The present volume in the ‘Focus on Biotechnology’ series, entiteld ‘Physics and Chemistry Basis for Biotechnology’ contains selected presentations from this meeting, A collection of experts has made serious efforts to present some of the latest developments in various scientific fields and to unveil prospective evolutions on the threshold of the new millenium. In all contributions the emphasis is on emerging new areas of research in which physicochemical principles form the foundation. In reading the different chapters, it appears that more than ever significant advances in biotechnology very often depend on breakthroughs in the biotechnology itself (e.g.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Analytical Molecular Biology illustrates the importance of simple analytical methods applied to some basic molecular biology problems, with an emphasis on the importance of biological problems, rather than the complexity of mathematics. First, the book examines crucial experimental data for a specific problem. Mathematical models will then be constructed with explicit inclusion of biological facts. From such models, predictions can be deduced and then suggest further experimental studies. A few important molecular biology problems will be discussed in the order of the complexity of the mathematical models. Based on such illustrations, the readers can then develop their own analytical methods to study their own problems. This book is for anyone who knows they need to learn how to apply mathematical models to biology, but doesn't necessarily want to, from practicing researchers looking to acquire more analytical tools to advanced students seeking a clear, explanatory text.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">African trypanosomes are tsetse-transmitted protozoa that inhabit the extracellular compartment of host blood. They cause fatal sleeping sickness in people, and Nagana, a wasting and generally fatal disease, in cattle. While trypanosomes are most common to Africa (about 30% of Africa's cattle graze on the fringe of the tsetse habitat), some species have spread beyond its boarders to Asia, the Middle East and South America. The African Trypanosomes, volume one of World Class Parasites, is written for researchers, students and scholars who enjoy reading research that has a major impact on human health, or agricultural productivity, and against which we have no satisfactory defense. It is intended to supplement more formal texts that cover taxonomy, life cycles, morphology, vector distribution, symptoms and treatment. It integrates vector, pathogen and host biology and celebrates the diversity of approach that comprises modern parasitological research.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Proteomics is an introduction to the exciting new field of proteomics, an interdisciplinary science that includes biology, bioinformatics, and protein chemistry. The purpose of this book is to provide the active researcher with an overview of the types of questions being addressed in proteomics studies and the technologies used to address those questions. Key subjects covered in this book include: an assessment of the limitations of this approach and outlines new developments in mass spectrometry that will advance future research high-throughput recombinant DNA cloning methods used to systematically clone all of the open reading frames of an organism into plasmid vectors for large scale protein expression and functional studies such as protein-protein interactions with the two-hybrid system protein structure an overview of large-scale experimental attempts to determine the three-dimensional structures of representative sets of proteins computational approaches to determining the three-dimensional structure of proteins. Proteomics provides a starting point for researchers who would like a theoretical understanding of the new technologies in the field, and obtain a solid grasp of the fundamentals before integrating new tools into their experiments. Written with attention to detail, but without being overwhelmingly technical, Proteomics is a user-friendly guide needed by most biologists today.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Classical conditioning of the nictitating membrane (NM) eyeblink response in rabbits is a useful model system for the study of the neurobiology of learning and memory. This paradigm that is so well described on a biological level has also been applied to studies of normal development over the life span and to instances of abnormal developmental phenomena. Eyeblink conditioning has been studied from molecular and neural network perspectives, and the paradigm is of demonstrated utility in elucidating mechanisms in physiology and pharmacology. This model system provides a behavioral paradigm in animals that has a close analog in human behavior. Perspectives of recent developments in human eyeblink classical conditioning research are presented in the companion volume to this book, Eyeblink Classical Conditioning: Applications in Humans.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">This volume has been composed as an appreciation of Martin L. Albert in the year of his 60th birthday. At least one contributor to each paper in this volume has been touched by Marty in some way; lie has mentored some, been a fellow student with some, and been a colleague to most. These contributors, as well as many others, view Marty as a gifted scientist and a wonderful human being. The breadth of his interests and intellectual pursuits is truly impressive; this breadth is reflected, only in part. by the diversity of the papers in this volume. His interests have ranged from psychopharmacology to cross-cultural understanding of dementia, through the aphasias, to the history of the fields that touch on behavioral neurology, especially neurology per se, cognitive psychology, speech-language pathology, and linguistics. Throughout his scholarly work, Martha Taylor Sarno notes, Marty never loses the human perspective, e. g. , the “powerfully disabling effect on the individual person” with aphasia or other neurological disorder. For those readers who only how a portion of his work, we thought that we should describe him here. Many of the people whom Marty has influenced have been able to contribute to this volume. We have invited some others who were unable to contribute to express their appreciation for him, as well.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Computational and Evolutionary Analysis of HIV Molecular Sequences is for all researchers interested in HIV research, even those who only have a nodding acquaintance with computational biology (or those who are familiar with some, but not all, aspects of the field). HIV research is unusual in that it brings together scientists from a wide range of disciplines: clinicians, pathologists, immunologists, epidemiologists, virologists, computational biologists, structural biologists, evolutionary biologists, statisticians and mathematicians. This book seeks to bridge the gap between these groups, in both subject matter and terminology. Focused largely on HIV genetic variation, Computational and Evolutionary Analysis of HIV Molecular Sequences covers such issues as sampling and processing sequences, population genetics, phylogenetics and drug targets.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">From the time questions about the impact of wireless technology on public health were first raised in 1993 through the present, Wireless Technology Research, LLC (WTR) has been the largest independent surveillance and research program trying to identify and solve human health problems associated with wireless phones. In 1995 at the University “La Sapienza” of Rome, WTR sponsored the first comprehensive forum for the discussion of these issues. Papers from the 1995 State of the Science Colloquium were collected andpublished in Volume I ofthis series, Wireless Phones andHealth: Scientific Progress. This second volume assembles papers presented at WTR’s Second State of the Science Colloquium in Long Beach, CA, in June 1999; it contains the most comprehensive research on the public health impact of wireless phones to date. The operating words for the proper understanding of these data are science and public health. Science is a tool for making public health decisions, but the framework in which we are operating is truly that of public health. We are looking for problems that have to do with wireless technology. We are trying to decide how this technology impacts on the public for one purpose and one purpose alone, and that purpose is to solve problems that are identified. I would like to challenge you, the reader, to suspend your parochial orientation as you consider these latest findings.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Susan Kemper A debate about the role of working memory in language processing has become center-most in psycholinguistics (Caplan &amp; Waters, in press; Just &amp; Carpenter, 1992; Just, Carpenter, &amp; Keller, 1996; Waters &amp; Caplan, 1996). This debate concerns which aspects of language processing are vulnerable to working memory limitations, how working memory is best measured, and whether compensatory processes can offset working memory limitations. Age-comparative studies are particularly relevant to this debate for several reasons: difficulties with language and communication are frequently mentioned by older adults and signal the onset of Alzheimer's dementia and other pathologies associated with age; older adults commonly experience working memory limitations that affect their ability to perform everyday activities; the rapid aging of the United States population has forced psychologists and gerontologists to examine the effects of aging on cognition, drawing many investigators to the study of cognitive aging. Older adults constitute ideal population for studying how working memory limitations affect cognitive performance, particularly language and communication. Age-comparative studies of cognitive processes have advanced our understanding of the temporal dynamics of cognition as well as the working memory demands of many types of tasks (Kliegl, Mayr, &amp; Krampe, 1994; Mayr &amp; Kliegl, 1993). The research findings reviewed in this volume have clear implications - for addressing the practical problems of older adults as consumers of leisure ti- reading, radio and television broadcasts, as targets of medical, legal, and financial documents, and as participants in a web of service agencies and volunteer activities.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Combinatorial chemistry and molecular diversity approaches to scientific inquiry and novel product R&amp;D have exploded in the 1990s! For example, in the preparation of drug candidates, the automated, permutational, and combinatorial use of chemical building blocks now allows the generation and screening of unprecedented numbers of compounds. Drug discovery - better, faster, cheaper? Indeed, more compounds have been made and screened in the 1990s than in the last hundred years of pharmaceutical research. This first volume covers: (i) combinatorial chemistry, (ii) combinatorial biology and evolution, and (iii) informatics and related topics. Within each section chapters are prepared by experts in the field, including, for example, in Section I: Coverage of mixture pools vs. parallel individual compound synthesis, solution vs. solid-phase synthesis, analytical tools, and automation. Section II highlights selection strategies and library-based evolution, phage display, peptide and nucleic acid libraries. Section III covers databases and library design, high through-put screening, coding strategies vs. deconvolutions, intellectual property issues, deals and collaborations, and successes to date.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Lead-based paint has become a national issue and will continue to be a hi- priority focus ofnational, state, and local agencies until there is no lead-based paint in the United States. Lead-based paint has become a tremendous health hazard for people and animals. Lead-based paint has been in widespread use throughout Europe and the United States. Lead has been known to be a health hazard since the time ofPliny the Elder (A. D. 23–79), but it was deemed that the advantages of lead in paint outweighed the health hazards. There has been a change in outlook, and in 1973 the U. S. Congress banned all lead paint from residential structures. A voluminous number of law suits have been initiated since, and continue to be litigated with the purpose of determining the parties responsible for the lead poisoning of children and others and to exact the indemnities. Lead-based paint is still authorized for use on bridges and nonresidential structures, and thousands of city, state, military, and federal government housing projects still contain lead-based paint. This paint must be removed if these dwellings are to be safe living quarters, especially for children. Aba- ment techniques continue to be evaluated; some have been used successfully. Lead-based paint abatement will continue into the next century, and it is hoped that this comprehensive volume will serve as a guide for those seriously interested in this important subject.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Even high-speed supercomputers cannot easily convert traditional two-dimensional databases from chemical topology into the three-dimensional ones demanded by today's chemists, particularly those working in drug design. This fascinating volume resolves this problem by positing mathematical and topological models which greatly expand the capabilities of chemical graph theory. The authors examine QSAR and molecular similarity studies, the relationship between the sequence of amino acids and the less familiar secondary and tertiary protein structures, and new topological methods.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">This book had its nucleus in some lectures given by one of us (J. O’M. B. ) in a course on electrochemistry to students of energy conversion at the University of Pennsyl- nia. It was there that he met a number of people trained in chemistry, physics, biology, metallurgy, and materials science, all of whom wanted to know something about electrochemistry. The concept of writing a book about electrochemistry which could be understood by people with very varied backgrounds was thereby engendered. The lectures were recorded and written up by Dr. Klaus Muller as a 293-page manuscript. At a later stage, A. K. N. R. joined the effort; it was decided to make a fresh start and to write a much more comprehensive text. Of methods for direct energy conversion, the electrochemical one is the most advanced and seems the most likely to become of considerable practical importance. Thus, conversion to electrochemically powered transportation systems appears to be an important step by means of which the difficulties of air pollution and the effects of an increasing concentration in the atmosphere of carbon dioxide may be met. Cor- sion is recognized as having an electrochemical basis. The synthesis of nylon now contains an important electrochemical stage. Some central biological mechanisms have been shown to take place by means of electrochemical reactions. A number of American organizations have recently recommended greatly increased activity in training and research in electrochemistry at universities in the United States.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Prof. Jerzy Sobkowski starts off this 31st volume of Modern Aspects of Electrochemistry with a far-ranging discussion of experimental results from the past 10 years of interfacial studies. It forms a good background for the two succeeding chapters. The second chapter is by S. U. M. Khan on quantum mechanical treatment of electrode processes. Dr. Khan’s experience in this area is a good basis for this chapter, the contents of which will surprise some, but which as been well refereed. Molecular dynamic simulation is now a much-used technique in physical electrochemistry and in the third chapter Ilan Benjamin has written an account that brings together information from many recent publications, sometimes confirming earlier modeling approaches and sometimes breaking new territory. In Chapter 4, Akiko Aramata’s experience in researching single crystals is put to good advantage in her authoritative article on under- tential deposition. Finally, in Chapter 5, the applied side of electrochemistry is served by Bech-Neilsen et al. in the review of recent techniques for automated measurement of corrosion. J. O’M.

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Experiments showing a rapid and reversible change of color seem to be magic and are always fascinating. This process called photochromism, has a few real and many potential applications. Photochromic glasses that darken in the sunlight (protecting eyes from excessive light intensity) and bleach in dim light are today a part of everyday life. Organic Photochromic Compounds in plastic ophthalmic lenses, more comfortable to wear, are now competing with silver salts glasses, despite the longer lifetime of the inorganic system. This successful commercial application has given a new impetus to research in the general field of photochromism that had its most recent revival in the early eighties. The story of organic photochromism with its ups and downs, from the breakthroughs of the pioneering period in the fifties, through the hard times due to the drawbacks of photodegradation and the recent successes is in many ways a saga. The upsurges in the domain were marked by an increasing flow of articles in scientific journals and the publication of several Books (in 1971, 1990 and 1992) which have collected the important accumulated knowledge. Over this period, a considerable number of patents have been issued. International meetings have accompanied this activity, the most recent being held in 1993 (ISOP 93 at Les Embiez Island, France) and in 1996 (ISOP 96 in Clearwater, Florida, USA). Remarkably, these meetings had a good representation from both academia and industry. The next ISOP is planned for 1999 in Fukuoka, Japan.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">With the development in the 1960s of ultrahigh vacuum equipment and techniques and electron, X-ray, and ion beam techniques to determine the structure and composition of interfaces, activities in the field of surface science grew nearly exponentially. Today surface science impacts all major fields of study from physical to biological sciences, from physics to chemistry, and all engineering disciplines. The materials and phenomena characterized by surface science range from se- conductors, where the impact of surface science has been critical to progress, to metals and ceramics, where selected contributions have been important, to bio- terials, where contributions are just beginning to impact the field, to textiles, where the impact has been marginal. With such a range of fields and applications, questions about sample selection, preparation, treatment, and handling are difficult to cover completely in one review article or one chapter. Therefore, the editors of this book have assembled a range of experts with experience in the major fields impacted by surface characterization. It is the only book which treats the subject of sample handling, preparation, and treatment for surface characterization. It is full of tricks, cautions, and handy tips to make the laboratory scientist’s life easier. With respect to organization of the book, the topics range from discussion of vacuum to discussion of biological, organic, elemental or compound samples, to samples prepared ex situ or in situ to the vacuum, to deposition ofthin films. Generic considerations of sample preparation are also given.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Many books are available that detail the basic principles of the different methods of surface characterization. On the other hand, the scientific literature provides a resource of how individual pieces of research are conducted by particular labo- tories. Between these two extremes the literature is thin but it is here that the present volume comfortably sits. Both the newcomer and the more mature scientist will find in these chapters a wealth of detail as well as advice and general guidance of the principal phenomena relevant to the study of real samples. In the analysis of samples, practical analysts have fairly simple models of how everything works. Superimposed on this ideal world is an understanding of how the parameters of the measurement method, the instrumentation, and the char- teristics of the sample distort this ideal world into something less precise, less controlled, and less understood. The guidance given in these chapters allows the scientist to understand how to obtain the most precise and understood measu- ments that are currently possible and, where there are inevitable problems, to have clear guidance as the extent of the problem and its likely behavior.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">This volume contains a series of papers originally presented at the symposium on Water Soluble Polymers: Solution Properties and Applications, sponsored by the Division of Colloids and Surface Chemistry of the American Chemical Society. The symposium took place in Las Vegas City, Nevada on 9 to 11th September, 1997 at the 214th American Chemical Society National Meeting. Recognized experts in their - spective fields were invited to speak. There was a strong attendance from academia, g- ernment, and industrial research centers. The purpose of the symposium was to present and discuss recent developments in the solution properties of water soluble polymers and their applications in aqueous systems. Water soluble polymers find applications in a number of fields of which the following may be worth mentioning: cosmetics, detergent, oral care, industrial water treatment, g- thermal, wastewater treatment, water purification and reuse, pulp and paper production, sugar refining, and many more. Moreover, water soluble polymers play vital role in the oil industry, especially in enhanced oil recovery. Water soluble polymers are also used in ag- culture and controlled release pharmaceutical applications. Therefore, a fundamental kno- edge of solution properties of these polymers is essential for most industrial scientists. An understanding of the basic phenomena involved in the application of these polymers, such as adsorption and interaction with different substrates (i. e. , tooth enamel, hair, reverse - mosis membrane, heat exchanger surfaces, etc. ) is of vital importance in developing high performance formulations for achieving optimum efficiency of the system.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">This book contains papers presented at the Engineering Foundation Conference on mineral matter in fuels held on November 2-7, 1997 in Kona, Hawaii. The conference is one of a continuing series that was initiated by the CEGB Mar- wood Engineering Laboratories in 1963. The conference was to be eventually organised by the Engineering Foundation as the need for multi-disciplinary work related to c- trolling ash effects in combustors became apparent. The conference covers both the science and the applications. The papers also present case histories, particularly for current fuel technologies, developments in advanced technologies for power generation and mathematical modelling of these processes. Developments since 1963 have been slow, but steady, due to the complexity of the chemical and physical processes involved. However, the research presented here displays great improvement in our understanding of the mechanisms by which mineral matter will influence fuel use. Steve Benson from EERC presented a review and current status of issues related to ash deposition in coal combustion and gasification. The application of new analytical tools, which have been detailed in the previous conferences, is presented. These include CCSEM, as well as new techniques for char- terising sintering of ash, such as TMA, image analysis, X-ray diffraction crystallography and thermal analysis. The new analytical techniques were extended to encompass widely differing fuels such as biomass. Ole H Larsen from ELSAM Denmark presented a review of these advanced techniques.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Several long-term trends in technology evolution have become apparent since these symposia began in 1989. Earlier presenters more frequently discussed treatment methods involving harsh and extensive human intervention. As the symposia have continued, the number of presentations describing extremely harsh and expensive treatment technologies have gradually been supplanted by more subtle and gentler methods. Such methods include subsurface-engineered barriers, phytoremediation, and bioremediation. Nineteen manuscripts were selected for inclusion in this volume, based upon peer review, scientific merit, the editors' perceptions of lasting value or innovative features, and the general applicability of either the technology itself or the scientific methods and scholarly details provided by the authors. General topics include: soil treatment, groundwater treatment, and radioactive waste treatment.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">In the future, our energy systems will need to be renewable and sustainable, efficient and cost-effective, convenient and safe. Hydrogen has been proposed as the perfect fuel for this future energy system. The availability of a reliable and cost-effective supply, safe and efficient storage, and convenient end use of hydrogen will be essential for a transition to a Hydrogen Economy. Research is being conducted throughout the world for the development of safe, cost-effective hydrogen production, storage, and end-use technologies that support and foster this transition. This book is a collection of important research and analysis papers on hydrogen production, storage, and end-use technologies that were presented at the American Chemical Society National Meeting in New Orleans, Louisiana, USA, in August 1999.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectroscopy - also sometimes termed Electron Spin Resonance spectroscopy - has manifold potential uses in biochemistry and medicine. The paramount importance of EPR spectroscopy applied to biological tissues and fluids is that it identifies the changes in redox processes that contribute to disease. EPR spectroscopy has come a long way from its original use to detect malignant tumors. For example, the development and later refinement of methods of low-temperature registration of biological tissues widened the scope of EPR spectroscopy. Innovations made possible by the introduction of spin labels, probes, and traps made EPR spectroscopy ever more applicable to biochemistry and medicine, to the point where in vivo studies are being carefully considered. This comprehensive book discusses spectra of many tissues and bodily fluids, and the quantitative nature of paramagnetic centers in both normal individuals and patients suffering from a variety of diseases. Special attention is given to the EPR examination of bio-molecules, such as enzymes, polypeptides, vitamins, lipids, hydrocarbons, etc., which play an essential role in human activity. This book will be of great interest to physicians specializing in many different areas. Similarly, biologists, biochemists, biophysicists, and chemists will find this book very useful. It has also been written so that it may be used as a textbook at graduate level.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">As we transition into the 21st century, it is apparent that this is an exciting time for environmental engineers and scientists studying remediation technologies. There has been a rapid development of new ways to clean-up polluted groundwater. Research activities of the past and next 10 years will have a dramatic impact on the quality of the subsurface environment for the next century. In 20, or even 10 years from now, our approach to subsurface remediation will probably be vastly different than it is today. Many of the emerging technologies presented in this book will form the basis of standard remediation practices of the future. Physicochemical Groundwater Remediation presents detailed information on multiple emerging technologies for the remediation of the contaminated subsurface environment. All of these technologies apply our knowledge of physical and chemical processes to clean up ground water and the unsaturated zone, and many (if not all) of these emerging technologies will help define standard practices in the future. These technologies include in situ sorptive and reactive treatment walls, surfactant-enhanced aquifer remediation, optimization analyses for remediation system design, chemical, electrochemical, and biochemical remediation processes, and monitored natural attenuation. You will learn how palladium catalyzes the dehalogenation of chlorinated solvents. You will find out how barometric pumping can naturally remove significant quantities of volatile organic pollutants from shallow ground water and the unsaturated zone. You can learn about mobilizing non-aqueous phase liquids (NAPLs) without risking significant downward migration of the NAPL. You can find out how processes such as electroosmosis and electromigration can be exploited for groundwater remediation purposes and how zero-valent iron and zeolite treatment walls can be used in situ to treat and control contaminant plume migration. Contributors to this book are experts in groundwater remediation processes, and they represent industry, consulting, academia, and government. If your work involves the clean up of contaminated soil and groundwater, this book is an essential reference to keep you up to date on the most promising new developments in remediation research.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">At the time when increasing numbers of chemists are being attracted by the fascination of supposedly easy computing and associated colourful imaging, this book appears as a counterpoint. The first part focuses on fundamental concepts of quantum chemistry, covering MCSCF theory, perturbation treatments, basis set developments, density matrices, wave function instabilities to correlation effects, and momentum space theory. The second part is devoted to more practical studies, ranging from the characterisation of exotic interstellar molecules, the accurate determination of spectroscopic constants, excited states structures and EPR parameters through photochemical and charge-transfer processes, cluster chemistry and fullerenes, muonium chemistry, to the possible prediction of the response of materials to electric fields in view of nonlinear optical applications. Audience: Graduate students and researchers whose work involves quantum chemistry, molecular physics, and materials modelling.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">This book gathers original contributions from a selected group of distinguished researchers that are actively working in the theory and practical applications of solvent effects and chemical reactions. The importance of getting a good understanding of surrounding media effects on chemical reacting system is difficult to overestimate. Applications go from condensed phase chemistry, biochemical reactions in vitro to biological systems in vivo. Catalysis is a phenomenon produced by a particular system interacting with the reacting subsystem. The result may be an increment of the chemical rate or sometimes a decreased one. At the bottom, catalytic sources can be characterized as a special kind of surrounding medium effect. The materials involving in catalysis may range from inorganic components as in zeolites, homogenous components, enzymes, catalytic antibodies, and ceramic materials. . With the enormous progress achieved by computing technology, an increasing number of models and phenomenological approaches are being used to describe the effects of a given surrounding medium on the electronic properties of selected subsystem. A number of quantum chemical methods and programs, currently applied to calculate in vacuum systems, have been supplemented with a variety of model representations. With the increasing number of methodologies applied to this important field, it is becoming more and more difficult for non-specialist to cope with theoretical developments and extended applications. For this and other reasons, it is was deemed timely to produce a book where methodology and applications were analyzed and reviewed by leading experts in the field.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Entropy and entropy generation play essential roles in our understanding of many diverse phenomena ranging from cosmology to biology. Their importance is manifest in areas of immediate practical interest such as the provision of global energy as well as in others of a more fundamental flavour such as the source of order and complexity in nature. They also form the basis of most modern formulations of both equilibrium and nonequilibrium thermodynamics. Today much progress is being made in our understanding of entropy and entropy generation in both fundamental aspects and application to concrete problems. The purpose of this volume is to present some of these recent and important results in a manner that not only appeals to the entropy specialist but also makes them accessible to the nonspecialist looking for an overview of the field. This book contains fourteen contributions by leading scientists in their fields. The content covers such topics as quantum thermodynamics, nonlinear processes, gravitational and irreversible thermodynamics, the thermodynamics of Taylor dispersion, higher order transport, the mesoscopic theory of liquid crystals, simulated annealing, information and biological aspects, global energy, photovoltaics, heat and mass transport and nonlinear electrochemical systems. Audience: This work will be of value to physicists, chemists, biologists and engineers interested in the theory and applications of entropy and its generation.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">The modeling of minerals and silicated materials is a. difficult challenge faced by Solid StatePhysics, Quantum Chemistry and Molecular Dynamics communities. The difficulty of such a modeling is due to the wide diversity of elements, including heavy atoms,and types of bonding involved in such systems. Moreover, one has to consider infinite systems: either perfect cr- tals or glasses and melts. In the solid state a given chemical composition gives rise to numerous polymorphs, geometricallycloselyrelated. These polymorphs have very similar energies and related thermodynamical pr- erties which explain the complexity of their phase diagrams. The modeling of silicates and minerals covers a wide field of applications ranging from basic research to technology, from Solid State Physics to Earth and Planetary science. The use of modeling techniques yields information of different nature. In the case of chemical studies, we can mention inv- tigations on catalytic processes occurring on surfaces and in zeolite cages. These calculations find possible applications in chemical engineering, in particular in the oil industry.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">A quantitative description of the action of enzymes and other biological systems is both a challenge and a fundamental requirement for further progress in our und- standing of biochemical processes. This can help in practical design of new drugs and in the development of artificial enzymes as well as in fundamental understanding of the factors that control the activity of biological systems. Structural and biochemical st- ies have yielded major insights about the action of biological molecules and the mechanism of enzymatic reactions. However it is not entirely clear how to use this - portant information in a consistent and quantitative analysis of the factors that are - sponsible for rate acceleration in enzyme active sites. The problem is associated with the fact that reaction rates are determined by energetics (i. e. activation energies) and the available experimental methods by themselves cannot provide a correlation - tween structure and energy. Even mutations of specific active site residues, which are extremely useful, cannot tell us about the totality of the interaction between the active site and the substrate. In fact, short of inventing experiments that allow one to measure the forces in enzyme active sites it is hard to see how can one use a direct experimental approach to unambiguously correlate the structure and function of enzymes. In fact, in view of the complexity of biological systems it seems that only computers can handle the task of providing a quantitative structure-function correlation.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">The field of composite materials has seen substantial development in the past decade, New composite systems are being continually developed for various applications. Among such systems are metal, intermetallic, and superalloy matrix composites, carbon-carbon composites as well as polymer matrix composites. At the same time, a new discipline has emerged of active or smart materials, which are often constructed as composite or heterogeneous media and structures. One unifying theme in these diverse systems is the influence that uncoupled and coupled eigenfields or transformation fields exert on the various types of overall response, as well as on the respective phase responses. Problems of this kind are currently considered by different groups which may not always appreciate the similarities of the problems involved. The purpose of the IUTAM Symposium on Transformation Problems in Composite and Active Materials held in Cairo, Egypt from March 10 to 12, 1997 was to bring together representatives of the different groups so that they may interact and explore common aspects of these seemingly different problem areas. New directions in micromechanics research in both composite and active materials were also explored in the symposium. Specifically, invited lectures in the areas of inelastic behavior of composite materials, shape memory effects, functionally graded materials, transformation problems in composite structures, and adaptive structures were delivered and discussed during the three-day meeting. This book contains the printed contributions to the IUTAM Symposium.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">The IUTAM Symposium on Rheology of Bodies with Defects was held in Beijing in September, 1997. It was aimed at the development of Rheology in Solid Mechanics. Rheology is classified in Applied Mechanics Review under fluid mechanics, however, in its broadest content as was envisaged in its earlier days, it covers the whole spectrum of material behavior from elasticity, plasticity, and fluid mechanics to gas dynamics. It was thought of as a branch of continuum mechanics, but emphasized the physical aspects of different materials, and frequently proceeded from basic physical principles. As the temperature rises, the distinction between solid and fluid, and the distinction between their micro-mechanical movements, become blurred. The physical description of such materials and their movements must be based on the thermodynamic principles of state variable theory; the classical division between solid and fluid mechanics disappears. Under the classification adopted by Applied Mechanics Reviews, the subjects dealt with in this symposium come closer to viscoelasticity and viscoplasticity, especially close to the subdivision of creep dealing with creep rupture. The symposium focused at building a bridge between macroscopic and microscopic research on damage and fracture behavior of defective bodies made of metal, polymer, composite and other viscoelastic materials. Two different approaches are presented at the symposium. The first is a continuum damage theory for time-dependent evolution of defects at the macro/meso/microscopic levels.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">The aim of this volume is to offer a balanced overview of molecular Rydberg spectroscopy as it has developed over recent decades. Recent evolution has split Rydberg spectroscopy into two apparently distinct fields: the one concerns the low (n=3-5) Rydberg states, the other the very high (typically n&gt;150) Rydberg states. The former is aimed at spectral levels where Rydberg, valence-shell, and intermediate-type states interact, with a variety of photochemical consequences. The latter considers states extremely close to the ionization limit, from whereionization is possible with a very slight amount of additional energy. Recently developed techniques make it possible to produce ions in well-defined electronic, vibrational and rotational states, including states resulting from spin-orbit or Jahn-Teller splitting. It is then possible to study the structure and reactions of such state-selected ions as well as those of the corresponding neutral molecules. These techniques amount to badly needed high resolution photoelectron spectroscopy.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">This book contains the edited version of invited lectures presented at the IUTAM-Sym- sium Synthesis in Bio Solid Mechanics, held at Hotel Frederiksdal, Virum (Copenhagen), Denmark, May 24 to May 27, 1998. The symposium was attended by 48 scientist from 14 countries. Biomechanics has been a very active research area in the last 25 years and covers a very broad class of problems. The present symposium concentrated on the solid mechanics - main of biomechanics, where important problems of synthesis presently are an active and challenging part. Characteristics of biomechanical materials are not only the inhomogeneity and anisotropy, but also the capability to change in relation to actual use. These living materials call for new methods of analysis and also new methods for synthesis. By the synthesis in this context is meant design of implants or artificial control of material growth. Bone mechanics is closely related to recent work on analysis and design of microstructural anisotropic materials. Also, recent work in shape design can to some extent be useful in the more complicated problems of biomechanics. Here interface problems play an essential role. The symposium brought together scientists from mechanics, mathematics and medicine.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">The aim of this book is to provide the reader with a modern presentation of ionic solutions at interfaces, for physical chemists, chemists and theoretically oriented experimentalists in this field. The discussion is mainly on the structural and thermodynamic properties, in relation to presently available statistical mechanical models. Some dynamic properties are also presented, at a more phenomenological level. The initial chapters are devoted to the presentation of some basic concepts for bulk properties: hydrodynamic interactions, electrostatics, van der Waals forces and thermodynamics of ionic solutions in the framework of a particular model: the mean spherical approximation (MSA). Specific features of interfaces are then discussed: experimental techniques such as in-situ X-ray diffraction, STM and AFM microscopy are described. Ions at liquid/air, liquid/metal and liquid/liquid interfaces are considered from the experimental and theoretical viewpoint. Lastly some dynamic (transport) properties are included, namely the self-diffusion and conductance of small colloids (polyelectrolytes and micelles) and the kinetics of solute transfer at free liquid/liquid interfaces.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">The electron density of a non-degenerate ground state system determines essentially all physical properties of the system. This statement of the Hohenberg–Kohn theorem of Density Functional Theory plays an exceptionally important role among all the fundamental relations of Molecular Physics. In particular, the electron density distribution and the dynamic properties of this density determine both the local and global reactivities of molecules. High resolution experimental electron densities are increasingly becoming available for more and more molecules, including macromolecules such as proteins. Furthermore, many of the early difficulties with the determination of electron densities in the vicinity of light nuclei have been overcome. These electron densities provide detailed information that gives important insight into the fundamentals of molecular structure and a better understanding of chemical reactions. The results of electron density analysis are used in a variety of applied fields, such as pharmaceutical drug discovery and biotechnology. If the functional form of a molecular electron density is known, then various molecular properties affecting reactivity can be determined by quantum chemical computational techniques or alternative approximate methods.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">hemistry is the science about breaking and forming of bonds between atoms. One of the most important processes for organic chemistry is breaking bonds C–H, as well as C–C in various compounds, and primarily, in hydrocarbons. Among hydrocarbons, saturated hydrocarbons, alkanes (methane, ethane, propane, hexane etc. ), are especially attractive as substrates for chemical transformations. This is because, on the one hand, alkanes are the main constituents of oil and natural gas, and consequently are the principal feedstocks for chemical industry. On the other hand, these substances are known to be the less reactive organic compounds. Saturated hydrocarbons may be called the “noble gases of organic chemistry” and, if so, the first representative of their family – methane – may be compared with extremely inert helium. As in all comparisons, this parallel between noble gases and alkanes is not fully accurate. Indeed the transformations of alkanes, including methane, have been known for a long time. These reactions involve the interaction with molecular oxygen from air (burning – the main source of energy!), as well as some mutual interconversions of saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons. However, all these transformations occur at elevated temperatures (higher than 300–500 °C) and are usually characterized by a lack of selectivity. The conversion of alkanes into carbon dioxide and water during burning is an extremely valuable process – but not from a chemist viewpoint.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Contributed by world-renowned specialists on the occasion of Paul Germain's 80th birthday, this unique book reflects the foundational works and the intellectual influence of this author. It presents the realm of modern thermomechanics with its extraordinary wealth of applications to the behaviour of materials, whether solid or fluid. The thirty-one contributions follow an easygoing autobiographical sketch by Paul Germain, and highlight the power and richness of a methodological approach to the phenomenology of many materials. This approach combines harmoniously thermodynamics and continuum theory in order to provide exploitable, thermodynamically admissible models of a large variety of behaviours and phenomena, including those of diffusion, thermoelasticity, viscoplasticity, relaxation, hysteresis, wetting, shape-memory effects, growth, phase transitions, stability, fracture, shocks, machining of materials, microstructured solids, complex fluids, etc. Especially aimed at graduate students, researchers, and engineers in mechanical engineering and materials science, this book also presents the state of the art in an active field of research and opens new horizons in other scientific fields, such as applied mathematics and applied physics, because of the intellectual satisfaction and remarkable efficiency provided by the advocated approach.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">In the last decade there have been numerous advances in the area of rhodium-catalyzed hydroformylation, such as highly selective catalysts of industrial importance, new insights into mechanisms of the reaction, very selective asymmetric catalysts, in situ characterization and application to organic synthesis. The views on hydroformylation which still prevail in the current textbooks have become obsolete in several respects. Therefore, it was felt timely to collect these advances in a book. The book contains a series of chapters discussing several rhodium systems arranged according to ligand type, including asymmetric ligands, a chapter on applications in organic chemistry, a chapter on modern processes and separations, and a chapter on catalyst preparation and laboratory techniques. This book concentrates on highlights, rather than a concise review mentioning all articles in just one line. The book aims at an audience of advanced students, experts in the field, and scientists from related fields. The didactic approach also makes it useful as a guide for an advanced course.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">The request to organize under its patronage at Poitiers in 1998 a Symposium entitled “Advanced Optical Methods and Applications in Solid Mechanics” by the International Union of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics (I.U.T.A.M.) was well received for the following two reasons. First, for nearly 20 years no Symposium devoted to optical methods in solids had been organized. Second, recent advances in digital image processing provided many new applications which are described in the following. We have the honour to present here the proceedings of this Symposium. st th The Symposium took place from august 31 to September 4 at the Institut International de la Prospective in Futuroscope near Poitiers. A significant number of internationally renowned specialists had expressed their wish to participate in this meeting. The Scientific Committee proposed 16 general conferences and selected 33 regular lectures and 17 poster presentations. Papers corresponding to posters are not differentiated in the proceedings from those that were presented orally. It is worth noting that a total of 80 participants, representing 16 countries, registered for this symposium.. The Scientific Committee deserves praise for attracting a significant number of young scientists, both as authors and as participants. Let us add our warm acknowledgements to Professor J.W. Dally and to Professor A.S. Kobayashi who, throughout the symposium preparation time, brought us valuable help.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">This book is meant to provide a window on the rapidly growing body of theoretical studies of condensed phase chemistry. A brief perusal of physical chemistry journals in the early to mid 1980’s will find a large number of theor- ical papers devoted to 3-body gas phase chemical reaction dynamics. The recent history of theoretical chemistry has seen an explosion of progress in the devel- ment of methods to study similar properties of systems with Avogadro’s number of particles. While the physical properties of condensed phase systems have long been principle targets of statistical mechanics, microscopic dynamic theories that start from detailed interaction potentials and build to first principles predictions of properties are now maturing at an extraordinary rate. The techniques in use range from classical studies of new Generalized Langevin Equations, semicl- sical studies for non-adiabatic chemical reactions in condensed phase, mixed quantum classical studies of biological systems, to fully quantum studies of m- els of condensed phase environments. These techniques have become sufficiently sophisticated, that theoretical prediction of behavior in actual condensed phase environments is now possible. and in some cases, theory is driving development in experiment. The authors and chapters in this book have been chosen to represent a wide variety in the current approaches to the theoretical chemistry of condensed phase systems. I have attempted a number of groupings of the chapters, but the - versity of the work always seems to frustrate entirely consistent grouping.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Modern Solid Mechanics considers phenomena at many levels, ranging from nano size at atomic scale through the continuum level at millimeter size to large structures at the tens of meter scale. The deformation and fracture behavior at these various scales are inextricably related to interdisciplinary methods derived from applied mathematics, physics, chemistry, and engineering mechanics. This book, in honor of James R. Rice, contains articles from his colleagues and former students that bring these sophisticated methods to bear on a wide range of problems. Articles discussing problems of deformation include topics of dislocation mechanics, second particle effects, plastic yield criterion on porous materials, hydrogen embrittlement, solid state sintering, nanophases at surfaces, adhesion and contact mechanics, diffuse instability in geomaterials, and percolation in metal deformation. In the fracture area, the topics include: elastic-plastic crack growth, dynamic fracture, stress intensity and J-integral analysis, stress-corrosion cracking, and fracture in single crystal, piezoelectric, composite and cementitious materials. The book will be a valuable resource for researchers in modern solid mechanics and can be used as reference or supplementary text in mechanical and civil engineering, applied mechanics, materials science, and engineering graduate courses on fracture mechanics, elasticity, plasticity, mechanics of materials or the application of solid mechanics to processing, and reliability of life predictions.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">During the last decades, continuum mechanics of porous materials has achieved great attention, since it allows for the consideration of the volumetrically coupled behaviour of the solid matrix deformation and the pore-fluid flow. Naturally, applications of porous media models range from civil and environmental engineering, where, e. g. , geote- nical problems like the consolidation problem are of great interest, via mechanical engineering, where, e. g. , the description of sinter materials or polymeric and metallic foams is a typical problem, to chemical and biomechanical engineering, where, e. g. , the complex structure of l- ing tissues is studied. Although these applications are principally very different, they basically fall into the category of multiphase materials, which can be described, on the macroscale, within the framework of the well-founded Theory of Porous Media (TPM). With the increasing power of computer hardware together with the rapidly decreasing computational costs, numerical solutions of complex coupled problems became possible and have been seriously investigated. However, since the quality of the numerical solutions strongly depends on the quality of the underlying physical model together with the experimental and mathematical possibilities to successfully determine realistic material parameters, a successful treatment of porous materials requires a joint consideration of continuum mechanics, experimental mechanics and numerical methods. In addition, micromechanical - vestigations and homogenization techniques are very helpful to increase the phenomenological understanding of such media.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">The optimal control of flexible structures is an active area of research. The main body of work in this area is concerned with the control of time-dependent displacements and stresses, and assumes linear elastic conditions, namely linear elastic material behavior and small defor- tion. See, e. g. , [1]–[3], the collections of papers [4, 5], and references therein. On the other hand, in the present paper we consider the static optimal control of a structure made of a nonlinear elastic material and und- going large deformation. An important application is the suppression of static or quasi-static elastic deformation in flexible space structures such as parts of satellites by the use of control loads [6]. Solar rad- tion and radiation from other sources induce a temperature field in the structure, which in turn generates an elastic displacement field. The displacements must usually satisfy certain limitations dictated by the allowed working conditions of various orientation-sensitive instruments and antennas in the space vehicle. For example, a parabolic reflector may cease to be effective when undergoing large deflection. The elastic deformation can be reduced by use of control loads, which may be imp- mented via mechanically-based actuators or more modern piezoelectric devices. When the structure under consideration is made of a rubb- like material and is undergoing large deformation, nonlinear material and geometric effects must be taken into account in the analysis.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">The IUTAM Symposium on Mechanical and Electromagnetic Waves in Structured Media took place at the University of Sydney from January 18- 22, 1999. It brought together leading researchers from eleven countries for a week-long meeting, with the aim of providing cross-links between the com- nities studying related problems involving elastic and electromagnetic waves in structured materials. After the meeting, participants were invited to submit articles based on their presentations, which were refereed and assembled to constitute these Proceedings. The topics covered here represent areas at the forefront of research intoelastic and electromagnetic waves. They include effect of nonlinearity, diffusion and multiple scattering on waves, as well as asymptotic and numerical techniques. Composite materials are discussed in depth, with example systems ranging fromdusty plasmas to a magneto-elastic microstructured system. Also included are studies of homogenisation, that field which seeks to determine equivalent homogeneous systems which can give equivalent wave properties to structured materials, and inverse problems, in which waves are used as a probe to infer structural details concerning scattering systems. There are also strong groups of papers on the localization of waves by random systems, and photonic and phononic band gap materials. These are being developed by analogue with semiconductors for electrons, and hold out the promise of enabling designers to control the propagation of waves through materials in novel ways.

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">The 20th International Congress of Theoretical and Applied Mech- ics, ICTAM 2000, took place August 27 – September 2, 2000, in the c- ference facilities of the Chicago Marriott Downtown on Michigan Avenue in Chicago, Illinois, USA. The Congress was invited by the US National Academy of Sciences on the recommendation of its National Comm- tee on Theoretical and Applied Mechanics. A consortium of university departments and programs acted as the local hosts. The undersigned served, respectively, as President and Secretary-General of the Congress. In this Proceedings volume we have attempted to capture the exci- ment of that memorable week. We have laid out the book so that it, roughly, tracks the events during the week of the Congress in much the order in which they occurred. We have given addresses and reports in context, although sometimes with embellishments to provide more data than could reasonably be presented orally. We have tried to reproduce essentials of the Opening and Closing ceremonies for the benefit of those who could not attend one or the other. We have tried to assemble an attractive volume that will have lasting value by adding an extensive name index and a briefer keyword index, and by exercising considerable care in the consistency of the layout of the full manuscripts. The international congresses of mechanics are major events of the field—we compare them to the Olympic Games in sports.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Principles of Digital Transmission is designed for advanced undergraduate and graduate level students and professions in telecommunications. Teachers and learners can mix and match chapters to create four distinct courses: (1) a one-term basic course in digital communications; (2) a one-term course in advanced digital communications; (3) a one-term course in information theory and coding; (4) a two-term course sequence in digital communications and coding. The book provides rigorous mathematical tools for the analysis and design of digital transmission systems. The authors emphasize methodology in their aim to teach the reader how to do it rather than how it is done. They apply the fundamental tools of the discipline onto a number of systems, such as wireless data transmission systems.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">As suggested by the title of this book, I will present a collection of coherently related applications and a theoretical development of a general systems theory. Hopefully, this book will invite all readers to sample an exciting and challenging (even fun!) piece of interdisciplinary research, that has characterized the scientific and technological achievements of the twentieth century. And, I hope that many of them will be motivated to do additional reading and to contribute to topics along the lines described in the following pages. Since the applications in this volume range through many scientific disciplines, from sociology to atomic physics, from Einstein’s relativity theory to Dirac’s quan tum mechanics, from optimization theory to unreasonable effectiveness of mathe matics to foundations of mathematical modeling, from general systems theory to Schwartz’s distributions, special care has been given to write each application in a language appropriate to that field. That is, mathematical symbols and abstractions are used at different levels so that readers in various fields will find it possible to read. Also, because of the wide range of applications, each chapter has been written so that, in general, there is no need to reference a different chapter in order to understand a specific application. At the same time, if a reader has the desire to go through the entire book without skipping any chapter, it is strongly suggested to refer back to Chapters 2 and 3 as often as possible.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">A gentle introduction to the highly sophisticated world of discrete mathematics, Mathematical Problems and Proofs presents topics ranging from elementary definitions and theorems to advanced topics -- such as cardinal numbers, generating functions, properties of Fibonacci numbers, and Euclidean algorithm. This excellent primer illustrates more than 150 solutions and proofs, thoroughly explained in clear language. The generous historical references and anecdotes interspersed throughout the text create interesting intermissions that will fuel readers' eagerness to inquire further about the topics and some of our greatest mathematicians. The author guides readers through the process of solving enigmatic proofs and problems, and assists them in making the transition from problem solving to theorem proving. At once a requisite text and an enjoyable read, Mathematical Problems and Proofs is an excellent entrée to discrete mathematics for advanced students interested in mathematics, engineering, and science.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">THE CONTEXT OF PARALLEL PROCESSING The field of digital computer architecture has grown explosively in the past two decades. Through a steady stream of experimental research, tool-building efforts, and theoretical studies, the design of an instruction-set architecture, once considered an art, has been transformed into one of the most quantitative branches of computer technology. At the same time, better understanding of various forms of concurrency, from standard pipelining to massive parallelism, and invention of architectural structures to support a reasonably efficient and user-friendly programming model for such systems, has allowed hardware performance to continue its exponential growth. This trend is expected to continue in the near future. This explosive growth, linked with the expectation that performance will continue its exponential rise with each new generation of hardware and that (in stark contrast to software) computer hardware will function correctly as soon as it comes off the assembly line, has its down side. It has led to unprecedented hardware complexity and almost intolerable dev- opment costs. The challenge facing current and future computer designers is to institute simplicity where we now have complexity; to use fundamental theories being developed in this area to gain performance and ease-of-use benefits from simpler circuits; to understand the interplay between technological capabilities and limitations, on the one hand, and design decisions based on user and application requirements on the other.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">This book reflects thirty years of experience in the applications of computer technology to literary research and instruction and in consulting work in office automation and system integration. In that time I have again and again found myself in the position of having to introduce students, both undergraduate and graduate, colleagues and clients to the fundamentals of computer hardware and software. Over the years, as computers became both central and commonplace in professional life, I have been aware of changing attitudes toward this technology. From attitudes that ranged from the disdain of platonic dialecticians for mere technology to intimidation bordering at times almost on terror, people have moved to incorporate this new technology into their frame of reference ( humani nil a me alienum ). The development of the microprocessor and its subsequent use for word processing marked one important watershed. The widespread use of word processors made it more likely than not that people would own their own computers, at least at work, and use them as part of their work-a-day activities. But while word processing provided some increased familiarity with computers, it did not lead most indivi- als much beyond a knowledge of the usual incantations needed to control the MultiMate or Nota Bene or Word Perfect golam and, as a result of unhappy experience, a begrudging acceptance of the need to make back up copies of important files.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">In 1978, when the book Living Systems was published, it contained the prediction that the sciences that were concerned with the biological and social sciences would, in the future, be stated as rigorously as the “hard sciences” that study such nonliving phenomena as temperature, distance, and the interaction of chemical elements. Principles of Quantitative Living Systems Science, the first of a planned series of three books, begins an attempt to fulfill that prediction. The view that living things are similar to other parts of the physical world, differing only in their complexity, was explicitly stated in the early years of the twentieth century by the biologist Ludwig von Bertalanffy. His ideas could not be published until the end of the war in Europe in the 1940s. Von Bertalanffy was strongly opposed to vitalism, the theory current among biologists at the time that life could only be explained by recourse to a “vital principle” or God. He c- sidered living things to be a part of the natural order, “systems” like atoms and molecules and planetary systems. Systems were described as being made up of a number of interrelated and interdependent parts, but because of the interrelations, the total system became more than the sum of those parts. These ideas led to the development of systems movements, in both Europe and the United States, that included not only biologists but scientists in other fields as well. Systems societies were formed on both continents.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Here is a comprehensive presentation of methodology for the design and synthesis of an intelligent complex robotic system, connecting formal tools from discrete system theory, artificial intelligence, neural network, and fuzzy logic. The necessary methods for solving real time action planning, coordination and control problems are described. A notable chapter presents a new approach to intelligent robotic agent control acting in a realworld environment based on a lifelong learning approach combining cognitive and reactive capabilities. Another key feature is the homogeneous description of all solutions and methods based on system theory formalism.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">This book provides an overview of the X Window System focusing on characteristics that have significant impact on the development of both application programs and widgets. We pay special attention to applications that go beyond graphical user interfaces (GUIs); therefore we discuss issues affecting video games, visualization and imaging programs, and designing widgets with a complex appearance. While the book does not assume previous knowledge of X, it is intended for experienced programmers, especially those who want to write programs that go beyond simple GUIs. X is the dominant window system under Unix, and X servers are available for Microsoft Windows, thus enabling graphics over a network in the PC world. While Java offers an apparently universal graphics library (the abstract window toolkit), the reality is quite different: For high-quality graphics and image display, we must program on the target platform itself (X or one of Microsoft’s APIs) rather than rely on Java peer objects. X is a vast subject, so it is impossible to provide a complete coverage in a few hundred pages. Thus we selected topics that are fundamental to the system, so that the reader who masters them should be able to read the documentation of the numerous libraries and toolkits. Therefore we provide documentation on the most important Xlib and X toolkit functions only.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Elliptic cohomology is an extremely beautiful theory with both geometric and arithmetic aspects. The former is explained by the fact that the theory is a quotient of oriented cobordism localised away from 2, the latter by the fact that the coefficients coincide with a ring of modular forms. The aim of the book is to construct this cohomology theory, and evaluate it on classifying spaces BG of finite groups G. This class of spaces is important, since (using ideas borrowed from `Monstrous Moonshine') it is possible to give a bundle-theoretic definition of EU-(BG). Concluding chapters also discuss variants, generalisations and potential applications.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Since the first edition of this book was published seven years ago, the field of modeling and simulation of communication systems has grown and matured in many ways, and the use of simulation as a day-to-day tool is now even more common practice. With the current interest in digital mobile communications, a primary area of application of modeling and simulation is now in wireless systems of a different flavor from the `traditional' ones. This second edition represents a substantial revision of the first, partly to accommodate the new applications that have arisen. New chapters include material on modeling and simulation of nonlinear systems, with a complementary section on related measurement techniques, channel modeling and three new case studies; a consolidated set of problems is provided at the end of the book.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Enterprises all over the world are experiencing a rapid development of networked computing for applications that are required for the daily survival of an organization. Client-server computing offers great potential for cost-effective networked computing. However, many organizations have now learned that the cost of maintenance and support of these networked distributed systems far exceeds the cost of buying them. Computer Supported Creative Work (CSCW) is the new evolving area that promotes the understanding of business processes and relevant communication technologies. Cooperative Management of Enterprise Networks uses CSCW as the medium for conveying ideas on the integration of business processes with network and systems management. This book will be useful for systems management professionals wishing to know about business process integration; business managers wishing to integrate their tasks with network/systems management; software system developers wishing to adopt participatory design practices; and students and researchers.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">1. MOTIVATION In many physical situations, a plant model is often provided with a qualitative or quantitative measure of associated model uncertainties. On the one hand, the validity of the model is guaranteed only inside a frequency band, so that nearly nothing can be said about the behavior of the real plant at high frequencies. On the other hand, if the model is derived on the basis of physical equations, it can be parameterized as a function of a few physical parameters, which are usually not perfectly known in practice. This is e.g. the case in aeronautical systems: as an example, the ae- dynamic model of an airplane is derived from the flight mechanics eq- tions. When synthesizing the aircraft control law, it is then necessary to take into account uncertainties in the values of the stability derivatives, which correspond to the physical coefficients of the aerodynamic model. Moreover, this airplane model does not perfectly represent the be- vior of the real aircraft. As a simple example, the flight control system or the autopilot are usually synthesized just using the aerodynamic model, thus without accounting for the flexible mechanicalstructure: the c- responding dynamics are indeed considered as high frequency neglected 1 dynamics, with respect to the dynamics of the rigid model .</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Multi-carrier modulation, in particular orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), has been successfully applied to a wide variety of digital communications applications for several years. Although OFDM has been chosen as the physical layer standard for a diversity of important systems, the theory, algorithms, and implementation techniques remain subjects of current interest. This book is intended to be a concise summary of the present state of the art of the theory and practice of OFDM technology. This book offers a unified presentation of OFDM theory and high speed and wireless applications. In particular, ADSL, wireless LAN, and digital broadcasting technologies are explained. It is hoped that this book will prove valuable both to developers of such systems, and to researchers and graduate students involved in analysis of digital communications, and will remain a valuable summary of the technology, providing an understanding of new advances as well as the present core technology.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Intuitionistic logic is presented here as part of familiar classical logic which allows mechanical extraction of programs from proofs. to make the material more accessible, basic techniques are presented first for propositional logic; Part II contains extensions to predicate logic. This material provides an introduction and a safe background for reading research literature in logic and computer science as well as advanced monographs. Readers are assumed to be familiar with basic notions of first order logic. One device for making this book short was inventing new proofs of several theorems. The presentation is based on natural deduction. The topics include programming interpretation of intuitionistic logic by simply typed lambda-calculus (Curry-Howard isomorphism), negative translation of classical into intuitionistic logic, normalization of natural deductions, applications to category theory, Kripke models, algebraic and topological semantics, proof-search methods, interpolation theorem. The text developed from materal for several courses taught at Stanford University in 1992-1999.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">This book introduces the fundamental concepts and practical simulation te- niques for modeling different aspects of operating systems to study their g- eral behavior and their performance. The approaches applied are obje- oriented modeling and process interaction approach to discrete-event simu- tion. The book depends on the basic modeling concepts and is more specialized than my previous book: Practical Process Simulation with Object-Oriented Techniques and C++, published by Artech House, Boston 1999. For a more detailed description see the Web location: http://science.kennesaw.edu/~jgarrido/mybook,html. Most other books on performance modeling use only analytical approaches, and very few apply these concepts to the study of operating systems. Thus, the unique feature of the book is that it concentrates on design aspects of operating systems using practical simulation techniques. In addition, the book illustrates the dynamic behavior of different aspects of operating systems using the various simulation models, with a general hands-on approach.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Graph Separators with Applications is devoted to techniques for obtaining upper and lower bounds on the sizes of graph separators - upper bounds being obtained via decomposition algorithms. The book surveys the main approaches to obtaining good graph separations, while the main focus of the book is on techniques for deriving lower bounds on the sizes of graph separators. This asymmetry in focus reflects our perception that the work on upper bounds, or algorithms, for graph separation is much better represented in the standard theory literature than is the work on lower bounds, which we perceive as being much more scattered throughout the literature on application areas. Given the multitude of notions of graph separator that have been developed and studied over the past (roughly) three decades, there is a need for a central, theory-oriented repository for the mass of results. The need is absolutely critical in the area of lower-bound techniques for graph separators, since these techniques have virtually never appeared in articles having the word `separator' or any of its near-synonyms in the title. Graph Separators with Applications fills this need.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">The solution of eigenvalue problems is an integral part of many scientific computations. For example, the numerical solution of problems in structural dynamics, electrical networks, macro-economics, quantum chemistry, and c- trol theory often requires solving eigenvalue problems. The coefficient matrix of the eigenvalue problem may be small to medium sized and dense, or large and sparse (containing many zeroelements). In the past tremendous advances have been achieved in the solution methods for symmetric eigenvalue pr- lems. The state of the art for nonsymmetric problems is not so advanced; nonsymmetric eigenvalue problems can be hopelessly difficult to solve in some situations due, for example, to poor conditioning. Good numerical algorithms for nonsymmetric eigenvalue problems also tend to be far more complex than their symmetric counterparts. This book deals with methods for solving a special nonsymmetric eig- value problem; the symplectic eigenvalue problem. The symplectic eigenvalue problem is helpful, e.g., in analyzing a number of different questions that arise in linear control theory for discrete-time systems. Certain quadratic eigenvalue problems arising, e.g., in finite element discretization in structural analysis, in acoustic simulation of poro-elastic materials, or in the elastic deformation of anisotropic materials can also lead to symplectic eigenvalue problems. The problem appears in other applications as well.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">A re-working of C.D. Chaffee's previously published The Rewiring of America (Academia, 1988), this professional book describes the fiber optics revolution. There have been many changes in the fiber optics field since the book's first publication. These include advances in optical networking; the additional bandwidth created by the Internet and associated data services; liberalization of the global telecommunications industry; and the rewiring of the world's oceans with fiber optics. Building the Global Fiber Optics Superhighway details all these developments. C.D. Chaffee writes: `One thing is clear: as our networks become primarily data-driven, they need to be built differently, to be able to handle data first, but also voice. It is a different way of looking at the world.'</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Most everything in our experience requires management in some form or other: our gardens, our automobiles, our minds, our bodies, our love lives, our businesses, our forests, our countries, etc. Sometimes we don’t call it “management” per se. We seldom talk about managing our minds or automobiles. But if we think of management in terms of monitoring, maintaining, and cultivating with respect to some goal, then it makes sense. We certainly monitor an automobile, albeit unconsciously, to make sure that it doesn’t exhibit signs of trouble. And we certainly try to cultivate our minds. This book is about managing networks. That itself is not a new concept. We’ve been managing the networks that support our telephones for about 100 years, and we’ve been managing the networks that support our computers for about 20 years. What is new (and what motivated me to write this book) is the following: (i) the enormous advancements in networking technology as we transition th st from the 20 century to the 21 century, (ii) the increasing dependence of human activities on networking technology, and (iii) the commercialization of services that depend on networking technology (e.g., email and electronic commerce).</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Active networking is an exciting new paradigm in digital networking that has the potential to revolutionize the manner in which communication takes place. It is an emerging technology, one in which new ideas are constantly being formulated and new topics of research are springing up even as this book is being written. This technology is very likely to appeal to a broad spectrum of users from academia and industry. Therefore, this book was written in a way that enables all these groups to understand the impact of active networking in their sphere of interest. Information services managers, network administrators, and e-commerce developers would like to know the potential benefits of the new technology to their businesses, networks, and applications. The book introduces the basic active networking paradigm and its potential impacts on the future of information handling in general and on communications in particular. This is useful for forward-looking businesses that wish to actively participate in the development of active networks and ensure a head start in the integration of the technology in their future products, be they applications or networks. Areas in which active networking is likely to make significant impact are identified, and the reader is pointed to any related ongoing research efforts in the area. The book also provides a deeper insight into the active networking model for students and researchers, who seek challenging topics that define or extend frontiers of the technology. It describes basic components of the model, explains some of the terms used by the active networking community, and provides the reader with taxonomy of the research being conducted at the time this book was written. Current efforts are classified based on typical research areas such as mobility, security, and management. The intent is to introduce the serious reader to the background regarding some of the models adopted by the community, to outline outstanding issues concerning active networking, and to provide a snapshot of the fast-changing landscape in active networking research. Management is a very important issue in active networks because of its open nature. The latter half of the book explains the architectural concepts of a model for managing active networks and the motivation for a reference model that addresses limitations of the current network management framework by leveraging the powerful features of active networking to develop an integrated framework. It also describes a novel application enabled by active network technology called the Active Virtual Network Management Prediction (AVNMP) algorithm. AVNMP is a pro-active management system; in other words, it provides the ability to solve a potential problem before it impacts the system by modeling network devices within the network itself and running that model ahead of real time.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">This book initiates a new digital multimedia standards series. The purpose of the series is to make information about digital multimedia standards readilyavailable. Both tutorial and advanced topics will be covered in the series, often in one book. Our hope is that users will find the series helpful in deciding what standards to support and use while implementors will d- cover a wealth of technical details that help them implement those standards correctly. In today's global economy standards are increasingly important. Yet until a standard is widely used, most of the benefits of standardization are not realized. We hope that standards committee chairpeople will organize and encourage a book in this series devoted to their new standard. This can be a forum to share and preserve some ofthe “why” and “how” that went into the development of the standard and, in the process, assist in the rapid adoption of the standard. Already in production for this series are books titled Digital Video: - troduction to MPEG-2 and Data Compression in Digital Systems.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Conflicts between agents acting in a multi-agent environment arise for different reasons, involve different concepts, and are dealt with in different ways, depending on the kind of agents and on the domain where they are considered. Agents may have conflicting beliefs, conflicting goals, or may have to share limited resources. Consequently, conflicts may be expressed as mere differences, or as contradictions, or even as social conflicts. They may be avoided, solved, kept, or even created deliberately. Conflicting Agents studies conflicts in the context of multi-agent systems, i.e. artificial societies modeled on the basis of autonomous, interacting agents. This book addresses questions about types of conflicts, conflict definitions and the use of conflicts as trigger functions for activities in multi-agent systems. The book is also dedicated to questions of conflict management, resolution and avoidance, i.e. the question of how agents cope with conflicts and conflicting situations.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">In recent years, tremendous research has been devoted to the design of database systems for real-time applications, called real-time database systems (RTDBS), where transactions are associated with deadlines on their completion times, and some of the data objects in the database are associated with temporal constraints on their validity. Examples of important applications of RTDBS include stock trading systems, navigation systems and computer integrated manufacturing. Different transaction scheduling algorithms and concurrency control protocols have been proposed to satisfy transaction timing data temporal constraints. Other design issues important to the performance of a RTDBS are buffer management, index accesses and I/O scheduling. Real-Time Database Systems: Architecture and Techniques summarizes important research results in this area, and serves as an excellent reference for practitioners, researchers and educators of real-time systems and database systems.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">"I have been using OmniMark for a decade to solve many different kinds of information management problems. When OmniMark Technologies Corporation added features to their excellent language that allowed server functionality and database access, OmniMark became an even better, more powerful platform for data processing. When they made it free, it made me wonder why anyone is still using Perl. I have used OmniMark as a very stable middle-tier programming language that is lightning fast, scaleable, and really fun to use. The language has a certain elegance that, once you learn how to `think OmniMark', you never want to even consider the alternatives. The native hierarchical architecture of the language, plus its luxuriously rich pattern matching syntax and support for structured information using XML and SGML parsing, make OmniMark a real joy. "This book covers the core language, plus practical examples for common Internet programming applications. OmniMark is such a powerful program that I can't think of any Internet programming problem that can't be solved with OmniMark. This book makes that clear in real, understandable terms." -Brian Travis, is the author of OmniMark At Work Volume 1: Getting Started and XML and SOAP Programming for Biz-Talk® Servers "OmniMark has been the secret weapon of markup language programmers since the earliest days of SGML. Its new XML support should bring it to a far wider audience." -Charles F. Goldfarb, is the inventor of SGML and author of The XML Handbook.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">This book emerged from teaching a graduate level course in propagation and smart antennas at the Naval Postgraduate School. In its present form, it is suitable not only as a graduate level text, but also as a reference book for industry and research use. The area of radiowave propagation and smart antennas is highly interdisciplinary, extracting material from electromagn- ics, communications, and signal processing. This book is useful to workers in electromagnetics who would like to supplement their background with relevant communicational aspects and to workers in communications who would like to supplement their background with relevant electromagnetic aspects. Anyone with a basic understanding of probability, wave propagation, digital com- nications, and elementary signal processing should be able to appreciate the contents of the book. The book consists of nine chapters with several worked out examples d- persed throughout. Chapter 1 covers the basics of cellular communications. Chapter 2 covers the basic principles of electromagnetic wave propagation relevant to path loss predictions in wireless communications. Students with little prior background in electromagnetics should find the first few sections of Chapter 2 self-sufficient. Empirical path loss models that are used in system design are treated in Chapter 3. The chapter includes the traditional models as well as some of the newer models. Chapter 4 has a thorough discussion on the causes and characterization of small scale fading. The topic of spatial c- relation that is very important for antenna arrays is discussed there in detail.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Current database technology and computer hardware allow us to gather, store, access, and manipulate massive volumes of raw data in an efficient and inexpensive manner. In addition, the amount of data collected and warehoused in all industries is growing every year at a phenomenal rate. Nevertheless, our ability to discover critical, non-obvious nuggets of useful information in data that could influence or help in the decision making process, is still limited. Knowledge discovery (KDD) and Data Mining (DM) is a new, multidisciplinary field that focuses on the overall process of information discovery from large volumes of data. The field combines database concepts and theory, machine learning, pattern recognition, statistics, artificial intelligence, uncertainty management, and high-performance computing. To remain competitive, businesses must apply data mining techniques such as classification, prediction, and clustering using tools such as neural networks, fuzzy logic, and decision trees to facilitate making strategic decisions on a daily basis. Knowledge Discovery for Business Information Systems contains a collection of 16 high quality articles written by experts in the KDD and DM field from the following countries: Austria, Australia, Bulgaria, Canada, China (Hong Kong), Estonia, Denmark, Germany, Italy, Poland, Singapore and USA.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Delivering MPEG-4 Based Audio-Visual Services investigates the different aspects of end-to-end multimedia services; content creation, server and service provider, network, and the end-user terminal. Part I provides a comprehensive introduction to digital video communications, MPEG standards, and technologies, and deals with system level issues including standardization and interoperability, user interaction, and the design of a distributed video server. Part II investigates the systems in the context of object-based multimedia services and presents a design for an object-based audio-visual terminal, some of these features having been adopted by the MPEG-4 Systems specification. The book goes on to study the requirements for a file format to represent object-based audio-visual content and the design of one such format. The design introduces new concepts such as direct streaming that are essential for scalable servers. The final part of the book examines the delivery of object-based multimedia presentations and gives optimal algorithms for multiplex-scheduling of object-based audio-visual presentations, showing that the audio-visual object scheduling problem is NP-complete in the strong sense. The problem of scheduling audio-visual objects is similar to the problem of sequencing jobs on a single machine. The book compares these problems and adapts job-sequencing results to audio-visual object scheduling, and provides optimal algorithms for scheduling presentations under resource constraints, such as bandwidth (network constraints) and buffer (terminal constraints). In addition, the book presents algorithms that minimize the resources required for scheduling presentations and the auxiliary capacity required to support interactivity in object-based audio-visual presentations. Delivering MPEG-4 Based Audio-Visual Services is essential reading for researchers and practitioners in the areas of multimedia systems engineering and multimedia computing, network professionals, service providers, and all scientists and technical managers interested in the most up-to-date MPEG standards and technologies.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">This book focuses on a specific engineering problem that is and will continue to be important in the forth-coming information age: namely, the need for highly integrated radio systems that can be embedded in wireless devices for various applications, including portable mobile multimedia wireless communications, wireless appliances, digital cellular, and digital cordless. Traditionally, the design of radio IC’s involves a team of engineers trained in a wide range of fields that include networking, communication systems, radio propagation, digital/analog circuits, RF circuits, and process technology. However as radio IC’s become more integrated, the need for a diverse skill set and knowledge becomes essential for professionals as well as students to broaden beyond their trained area of expertise and to become proficient in related areas. The key to designing an optimized, economical solution for radio systems on a chip hinges on the designer’s thorough understanding of the complex trade-offs from communication systems down to circuits. To acquire the insight and understanding of the complex system and circuit trade-offs, a designer must digest volumes of books covering diverse topics, such as communications theory, radio propagation, and digital/analog/RF circuits. While books are available today that cover the individual areas, they tend to be narrowly focused and do not provide the necessary insight in the specific problem of integrating a complete radio system on a chip.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">The Analog to Digital Converters represent one half of the link between the world we live in - analog - and the digital world of computers, which can handle the computations required in digital signal processing. These devices are mathematically very complex due to their nonlinear behavior and thus fairly difficult to analyze without the use of simulation tools. High Speed A/D Converters: Understanding Data Converters Through SPICE presents the subject from the practising engineer's point of view rather than from the academic's point of view. A practical approach is emphasized. High Speed A/D Converters: Understanding Data Converters Through SPICE is intended as a learning tool by providing building blocks that can be stacked on top of each other to build higher order systems. The book provides a guide to understanding the various topologies used in A/D converters by suggesting simple methods for the blocks used in an A/D converter. The converters discussed throughout the book constitute a class of devices called undersampled or Nyquist converters. The tools used in deriving the results presented are: TopSpice® by Penzar - a mixed mode SPICE simulator - version 5.90. The files included in Appendix A were written for this tool. However, most circuit files need only minor adjustments to be used on other SPICE simulators such as PSpice, Hspice, IS_Spice and Micro-Cap IV; Mathcad 2000 - Professional by Mathsoft. This tool is very useful in performing FFT analysis as well as drawing some of the graphs. Again, the mathcad files are included to help the user analyze the data. High Speed A/D Converters: Understanding Data Converters Through SPICE not only supplies the models for the A/D converters for SPICE program but also describes the physical reasons for the converter's performance.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Bayesian Approach to Image Interpretation will interest anyone working in image interpretation. It is complete in itself and includes background material. This makes it useful for a novice as well as for an expert. It reviews some of the existing probabilistic methods for image interpretation and presents some new results. Additionally, there is extensive bibliography covering references in varied areas. For a researcher in this field, the material on synergistic integration of segmentation and interpretation modules and the Bayesian approach to image interpretation will be beneficial. For a practicing engineer, the procedure for generating knowledge base, selecting initial temperature for the simulated annealing algorithm, and some implementation issues will be valuable. New ideas introduced in the book include: New approach to image interpretation using synergism between the segmentation and the interpretation modules. A new segmentation algorithm based on multiresolution analysis. Novel use of the Bayesian networks (causal networks) for image interpretation. Emphasis on making the interpretation approach less dependent on the knowledge base and hence more reliable by modeling the knowledge base in a probabilistic framework. Useful in both the academic and industrial research worlds, Bayesian Approach to Image Interpretation may also be used as a textbook for a semester course in computer vision or pattern recognition.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Since the early eighties IFIP/Sec has been an important rendezvous for Information Technology researchers and specialists involved in all aspects of IT security. The explosive growth of the Web is now faced with the formidable challenge of providing trusted information. IFIP/Sec’01 is the first of this decade (and century) and it will be devoted to “Trusted Information - the New Decade Challenge” This proceedings are divided in eleven parts related to the conference program. Session are dedicated to technologies: Security Protocols, Smart Card, Network Security and Intrusion Detection, Trusted Platforms. Others sessions are devoted to application like eSociety, TTP Management and PKI, Secure Workflow Environment, Secure Group Communications, and on the deployment of applications: Risk Management, Security Policies andTrusted System Design and Management. The year 2001 is a double anniversary. First, fifteen years ago, the first IFIP/Sec was held in France (IFIP/Sec’86, Monte-Carlo) and 2001 is also the anniversary of smart card technology. Smart cards emerged some twenty years ago as an innovation and have now become pervasive information devices used for highly distributed secure applications. These cards let millions of people carry a highly secure device that can represent them on a variety of networks. To conclude, we hope that the rich “menu” of conference papers for this IFIP/Sec conference will provide valuable insights and encourage specialists to pursue their work in trusted information.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">The broadband wireless communications field is growing at an explosive rate, stimulated by a host of important emerging applications ranging from 3G, 4G and wireless LAN. Wideband CDMA and CDMA2000 will be used for 3G. OFDM+CDMA might be a good choice for 4G, CDMA overlay will possibly be used for new-generation broadband wireless LAN. For system planners and designers, the projections of rapidly escalating demand for such wireless services present major challenges and meeting these challenges will require sustained technical innovation on many fronts. The text of this book has been developed through years of research by the author and his graduate students at the University of Hong Kong. The aim of this book is to provide a R&amp;D perspective on the field of broadband wireless communications by describing the recent research developments in this area and also by identifying key directions in which further research is needed. As a background, I presume that the reader has a thorough understanding of digital communications and spread spectrum/CDMA. The book is arranged into 13 chapters. In chapter 1, some key specifications of 3G WCDMA are described and discussed. These techniques include channel coding, rate matching, modulation and spreading, power control, cell search, transmit diversity, soft-handoff, and so son. In Chapter 2, the coherent RAKE reception of Wideband CDMA signals with complex spreading is considered. A dedicated pilot channel, which is separate from data channels, is used for the purpose of channel estimation.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">The growth of telecommunications has been largely based on mobile and data services in the past 10 years and the growth will continue. For instance, it is forecasted that after 2005 the mobile traffic turnover in Europe will exceed that of fixed telephone traffic and the penetration of Internet access through mobile will exceed that of fixed access. It is expected that the new value added services will be Internet-based and the IP traffic will outweigh the amount of traditional ISDN based telephone traffic. The transition from the existing telecommunications services to mobile and Internet based ones will change the service infrastructure as well as the customer and service management structures. In wireless communications there are several new standards being developed and implemented to improve the data transmission rate over radio channels, to combine both voice, packet data and multimedia services in the terminals and to improve the service quality and usability. Narrow band packet radio standards such as General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) and i-Mode are already operative and broadband IMT-2000 standards, also called as Third Generation (3G) Mobile, have been developed in Japan, Europe and US. At the same time Wireless LAN and Bluetooth technologies mature and provide short-range data access to terminal devices. The emerging new technologies create opportunities not only to incumbent teleoperators but also to new network operators, IT companies and new service and content providers.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Deformable avatars are virtual humans that deform themselves during motion. This implies facial deformations, body deformations at joints, and global deformations. Simulating deformable avatars ensures a more realistic simulation of virtual humans. The research requires models for capturing of geometrie and kinematic data, the synthesis of the realistic human shape and motion, the parametrisation and motion retargeting, and several appropriate deformation models. Once a deformable avatar has been created and animated, the researcher must model high-level behavior and introduce agent technology. The book can be divided into 5 subtopics: 1. Motion capture and 3D reconstruction 2. Parametrie motion and retargeting 3. Musc1es and deformation models 4. Facial animation and communication 5. High-level behaviors and autonomous agents Most of the papers were presented during the IFIP workshop "DEFORM '2000" that was held at the University of Geneva in December 2000, followed by "A V AT ARS 2000" held at EPFL, Lausanne. The two workshops were sponsored by the "Troisü!me Cycle Romand d'Informatique" and allowed participants to discuss the state of research in these important areas. x Preface We would like to thank IFIP for its support and Yana Lambert from Kluwer Academic Publishers for her advice. Finally, we are very grateful to Zerrin Celebi, who has prepared the edited version of this book and Dr. Laurent Moccozet for his collaboration.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Distributed applications are a necessity in most central application sectors of the contemporary information society, including e-commerce, e-banking, e-learning, e-health, telecommunication and transportation. This results from a tremendous growth of the role that the Internet plays in business, administration and our everyday activities. This trend is going to be even further expanded in the context of advances in broadband wireless communication. New Developments in Distributed Applications and Interoperable Systems focuses on the techniques available or under development with the goal to ease the burden of constructing reliable and maintainable interoperable information systems providing services in the global communicating environment. The topics covered in this book include: Context-aware applications; Integration and interoperability of distributed systems; Software architectures and services for open distributed systems; Management, security and quality of service issues in distributed systems; Software agents and mobility; Internet and other related problem areas. The book contains the proceedings of the Third International Working Conference on Distributed Applications and Interoperable Systems (DAIS'2001), which was held in September 2001 in Kraków, Poland, and sponsored by the International Federation on Information Processing (IFIP). The conference program presents the state of the art in research concerning distributed and interoperable systems. This is a topical research area where much activity is currently in progress. Interesting new aspects and innovative contributions are still arising regularly. The DAIS series of conferences is one of the main international forums where these important findings are reported.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">New Zealand schools have experienced unprecedented change during the lastdecade. Radicalrestructuringoftheframeworksforbothcurriculumand qualificationsfollowedamovementtowards self-managementin 1989. The curriculum framework, consisting of seven essential learning areas, has been progressively introduced with completionnotexpecteduntil 2002. Thenew Qualifications Framework, based on unit standards, was launched in 1994. The introduction of unit standards signalled an emphatic movement towards the use of internal assessment for awarding qualifications at the seniorsecondaryschoollevel. Eachcoursehadunitstandardsdefined,which described the outcomes and the performance criteria that would be used to determine whether or not the standard had been achieved. Approximately five to eight standards would be used for each full year course and each standard had a number of credits associated with it. The plan, which has since been modified, was for these credits to contribute to a National Certificate of Educational Achievement, at years 12 and 13, and other, subject specific, National Certificates. Secondary schools were faced with the task of recording and reporting 1 unit standardresults to theNew Zealand Qualifications Authority . This, by itself, was not a major issue as the significant suppliers of CSIS had modules availablewhichsatisfiedthis need. Atthistimeamodelwasbeingpresented to school audiences demonstrating how the recording, reporting and evaluation ofassessment data, relating to the curriculumframework, could be relatively straight forward IF there was a common assessment ‘currency’ across the school. This model was converted into software form for demonstration purposes.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">The Eighth Annual Working Conference of Information Security Management and Small Systems Security, jointly presented by WG11.1 and WG11.2 of the International Federation for Information Processing (IFIP), focuses on various state-of-art concepts in the two relevant fields. The conference focuses on technical, functional as well as managerial issues. This working conference brings together researchers and practitioners of different disciplines, organisations, and countries, to discuss the latest developments in (amongst others) information security methods, methodologies and techniques, information security management issues, risk analysis, managing information security within electronic commerce, computer crime and intrusion detection. We are fortunate to have attracted two highly acclaimed international speakers to present invited lectures, which will set the platform for the reviewed papers. Invited speakers will talk on a broad spectrum of issues, all related to information security management and small system security issues. These talks cover new perspectives on electronic commerce, security strategies, documentation and many more. All papers presented at this conference were reviewed by a minimum of two international reviewers. We wish to express our gratitude to all authors of papers and the international referee board. We would also like to express our appreciation to the organising committee, chaired by Gurpreet Dhillon, for all their inputs and arrangements. Finally, we would like to thank Les Labuschagne and Hein Venter for their contributions in compiling this proceeding for WG11.1 and WG 11.2.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Data mining involves the non-trivial extraction of implicit, previously unknown, and potentially useful information from databases. Genetic Programming (GP) and Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) are two of the approaches for data mining. This book first sets the necessary backgrounds for the reader, including an overview of data mining, evolutionary algorithms and inductive logic programming. It then describes a framework, called GGP (Generic Genetic Programming), that integrates GP and ILP based on a formalism of logic grammars. The formalism is powerful enough to represent context- sensitive information and domain-dependent knowledge. This knowledge can be used to accelerate the learning speed and/or improve the quality of the knowledge induced. A grammar-based genetic programming system called LOGENPRO (The LOGic grammar based GENetic PROgramming system) is detailed and tested on many problems in data mining. It is found that LOGENPRO outperforms some ILP systems. We have also illustrated how to apply LOGENPRO to emulate Automatically Defined Functions (ADFs) to discover problem representation primitives automatically. By employing various knowledge about the problem being solved, LOGENPRO can find a solution much faster than ADFs and the computation required by LOGENPRO is much smaller than that of ADFs. Moreover, LOGENPRO can emulate the effects of Strongly Type Genetic Programming and ADFs simultaneously and effortlessly. Data Mining Using Grammar Based Genetic Programming and Applications is appropriate for researchers, practitioners and clinicians interested in genetic programming, data mining, and the extraction of data from databases.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Market demand for microprocessor performance has motivated continued scaling of CMOS through a succession of lithography generations. Quantum mechanical limitations to continued scaling are becoming readily apparent. Partially Depleted Silicon-on-Insulator (PD-SOI) technology is emerging as a promising means of addressing these limitations. It also introduces additional design complexity which must be well understood. SOI Circuit Design Concepts first introduces the student or practicing engineer to SOI device physics and its fundamental idiosyncrasies. It then walks the reader through realizations of these mechanisms which are observed in common high-speed microprocessor designs. Rules of thumb and comparisons to conventional bulk CMOS are offered to guide implementation. SOI's ultimate advantage, however, may lie in the unique circuit topologies it supports; a number of these novel new approaches are described as well. SOI Circuit Design Concepts draws upon the latest industry literature as well as the firsthand experiences of its authors. It is an ideal introduction to the concepts of governing SOI use and provides a firm foundation for further study of this exciting new technology paradigm.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">There is an ever increasing trend towards putting entire systems on a single chip. This means that analog circuits will have to coexist on the same substrate along with massive digital systems. Since technologies are optimized with these digital systems in mind, designers will have to make do with standard CMOS processes in the years to come. We address analog filter design from this perspective. Filters form important blocks in applications ranging from computer disc-drive chips to radio transceivers. In this book, we develop the theory and techniques necessary for the implementation of high frequency (hundreds of megahertz) programmable continuous time filters in standard CMOS processes. Since high density poly-poly capacitors are not available in these technologies, alternative capacitor structures have to be found. Met- metal capacitors have low specific capacitance. An alternative is to use the (inherently nonlinear) capacitance formed by MOSFET gates. In Chapter 2, we focus on the use of MOS capacitors as integrating elements. A physics-based model which predicts distortion accurately is presented for a two-terminal MOS structure in accumulation. Distortion in these capacitors as a function of signal swing and bias voltage is computed. Chapter 3 reviews continuous-time filter architectures in the light of bias-dependent integrating capacitors. We also discuss the merits and demerits of various CMOS transconductance elements. The problems encountered in designing high frequency programmable filters are discussed in detail.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Principles of Verifiable RTL Design: A Functional Coding Style Supporting Verification Processes in Verilog explains how you can write Verilog to describe chip designs at the RT-level in a manner that cooperates with verification processes. This cooperation can return an order of magnitude improvement in performance and capacity from tools such as simulation and equivalence checkers. It reduces the labor costs of coverage and formal model checking by facilitating communication between the design engineer and the verification engineer. It also orients the RTL style to provide more useful results from the overall verification process. The intended audience for Principles of Verifiable RTL Design: A Functional Coding Style Supporting Verification Processes in Verilog is engineers and students who need an introduction to various design verification processes and a supporting functional Verilog RTL coding style. A second intended audience is engineers who have been through introductory training in Verilog and now want to develop good RTL writing practices for verification. A third audience is Verilog language instructors who are using a general text on Verilog as the course textbook but want to enrich their lectures with an emphasis on verification. A fourth audience is engineers with substantial Verilog experience who want to improve their Verilog practice to work better with RTL Verilog verification tools. A fifth audience is design consultants searching for proven verification-centric methodologies. A sixth audience is EDA verification tool implementers who want some suggestions about a minimal Verilog verification subset. Principles of Verifiable RTL Design: A Functional Coding Style Supporting Verification Processes in Verilog is based on the reality that comes from actual large-scale product design process and tool experience.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Data Mining in Finance presents a comprehensive overview of major algorithmic approaches to predictive data mining, including statistical, neural networks, ruled-based, decision-tree, and fuzzy-logic methods, and then examines the suitability of these approaches to financial data mining. The book focuses specifically on relational data mining (RDM), which is a learning method able to learn more expressive rules than other symbolic approaches. RDM is thus better suited for financial mining, because it is able to make greater use of underlying domain knowledge. Relational data mining also has a better ability to explain the discovered rules - an ability critical for avoiding spurious patterns which inevitably arise when the number of variables examined is very large. The earlier algorithms for relational data mining, also known as inductive logic programming (ILP), suffer from a relative computational inefficiency and have rather limited tools for processing numerical data. Data Mining in Finance introduces a new approach, combining relational data mining with the analysis of statistical significance of discovered rules. This reduces the search space and speeds up the algorithms. The book also presents interactive and fuzzy-logic tools for `mining' the knowledge from the experts, further reducing the search space. Data Mining in Finance contains a number of practical examples of forecasting S&amp;P 500, exchange rates, stock directions, and rating stocks for portfolio, allowing interested readers to start building their own models. This book is an excellent reference for researchers and professionals in the fields of artificial intelligence, machine learning, data mining, knowledge discovery, and applied mathematics.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">The Center for Intelligent Information Retrieval (CIIR) was formed in the Computer Science Department ofthe University ofMassachusetts, Amherst in 1992. The core support for the Center came from a National Science Foun- tion State/Industry/University Cooperative Research Center(S/IUCRC) grant, although there had been a sizeable information retrieval (IR) research group for over 10 years prior to that grant. Thebasic goal ofthese Centers is to combine basic research, applied research, and technology transfer. The CIIR has been successful in each of these areas, in that it has produced over 270 research papers, has been involved in many successful government and industry collaborations, and has had a significant role in high-visibility Internet sites and start-ups. As a result of these efforts, the CIIR has become known internationally as one of the leading research groups in the area of information retrieval. The CIIR focuses on research that results in more effective and efficient access and discovery in large, heterogeneous, distributed, text and multimedia databases. The scope of the work that is done in the CIIR is broad and goes significantly beyond “traditional” areas of information retrieval such as retrieval models, cross-lingual search, and automatic query expansion. The research includes both low-level systems issues such as the design of protocols and architectures for distributed search, as well as more human-centered topics such as user interface design, visualization and data mining with text, and multimedia retrieval.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Optical WDM networking technology is spearheading a bandwidth revolution in the networking infrastructure being developed for the next generation Internet. Rapid advances in optical components have enabled the transition from point-to-point WDM links to all-optical networking. Optical WDM Networks: Principles and Practice presents some of the most important challenges facing the optical networking community, along with some suggested solutions. Earlier textbooks in optical networking have a narrower perspective, and rapidly advancing research has created the need for fresh and current information on problems and issues in the field. The volume editors and contributing authors have endeavoured to capture a substantial subset of the key problems and known solutions to these problems. All of the chapters are original contributions from leading international researchers. The chapters address a wide variety of topics, including the state of the art in WDM technology, physical components that make up WDM fiber-optic networks, medium access protocols, wavelength routed networks, optical access networks, network management, and performance evaluation of wavelength routing networks. The chapters also survey critical points in past research and tackle more recent problems. Practitioners and network product engineers interested in current state-of-the-art information beyond textbook-type coverage, and graduate students commencing research in this area, will appreciate the concise - and pertinent - information presented herein.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Middleware Networks: Concept, Design and Deployment of Internet Infrastructure describes a framework for developing IP Service Platforms and emerging managed IP networks with a reference architecture from the AT&amp;T Labs GeoPlex project. The main goal is to present basic principles that both the telecommunications industry and the Internet community can see as providing benefits for service-related network issues. As this is an emerging technology, the solutions presented are timely and significant. Middleware Networks: Concept, Design and Deployment of Internet Infrastructure illustrates the principles of middleware networks, including Application Program Interfaces (APIs), reference architecture, and a model implementation. Part I begins with fundamentals of transport, and quickly transitions to modern transport and technology. Part II elucidates essential requirements and unifying design principles for the Internet. These fundamental principles establish the basis for consistent behavior in view of the explosive growth underway in large-scale heterogeneous networks. Part III demonstrates and explains the resulting architecture and implementation. Particular emphasis is placed upon the control of resources and behavior. Reference is made to open APIs and sample deployments. Middleware Networks: Concept, Design and Deployment of Internet Infrastructure is intended for a technical audience consisting of students, researchers, network professionals, software developers, system architects and technically-oriented managers involved in the definition and deployment of modern Internet platforms or services. Although the book assumes a basic technical competency, as it does not provide remedial essentials, any practitioner will find this useful, particularly those requiring an overview of the newest software architectures in the field.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Information Highways are widely considered as the next generation of high speed communication systems. These highways will be based on emerging Broadband Integrated Services Digital Networks (B-ISDN), which - at least in principle - are envisioned to support not only all the kinds of networking applications known today but also future applications which are not as yet understood fully or even anticipated. Thus, B-ISDNs release networking processes from the limitations which the communications medium has imposed historically. The operational generality stems from the versatility of Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) which is the transfer mode adopted by ITU-T for broadband public ISDN as well as wide area private ISDN. A transfer mode which provides the transmission, multiplexing and switching core that lies at the foundations of a communication network. ATM is designed to integrate existing and future voice, audio, image and data services. Moreover, ATM aims to minimise the complexity of switching and buffer management, to optimise intermediate node processing and buffering and to bound transmission delays. These design objectives are met at high transmission speeds by keeping the basic unit of ATM transmission - the ATM cell - short and of fixed length.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">In our increasingly mobile world the ability to access information on demand at any time and place can satisfy people's information needs as well as confer on them a competitive advantage. The emergence of battery-operated, low-cost and portable computers such as palmtops and PDAs, coupled with the availability and exploitation of wireless networks, have made possible the potential for ubiquitous computing. Through the wireless networks, portable equipments will become an integrated part of existing distributed computing environments, and mobile users can have access to data stored at information servers located at the static portion of the network even while they are on the move. Traditionally, information is retrieved following a request-response model. However, this model is no longer adequate in a wireless computing environment. First, the wireless channel is unreliable and the bandwidth is low compared to the wired counterpart. Second, the environment is essentially asymmetric with a large number of mobile users accessing a small number of servers. Third, battery-operated portable devices can typically operate only for a short time because of the short battery lifespan. Thus, clients are expected to be disconnected most of the time. To overcome these limitations, there has been a proliferation of research efforts on designing data delivery mechanisms to support wireless computing more effectively. Data Dissemination in Wireless Computing Environments focuses on such mechanisms. The purpose is to provide a thorough and comprehensive review of recent advances on energy-efficient data delivery protocols, efficient wireless channel bandwidth utilization, reliable broadcasting and cache invalidation strategies for clients with long disconnection time. Besides surveying existing methods, this book also compares and evaluates some of the more promising schemes.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Robust Speech Recognition in Embedded Systems and PC Applications provides a link between the technology and the application worlds. As speech recognition technology is now good enough for a number of applications and the core technology is well established around hidden Markov models many of the differences between systems found in the field are related to implementation variants. We distinguish between embedded systems and PC-based applications. Embedded applications are usually cost sensitive and require very simple and optimized methods to be viable. Robust Speech Recognition in Embedded Systems and PC Applications reviews the problems of robust speech recognition, summarizes the current state of the art of robust speech recognition while providing some perspectives, and goes over the complementary technologies that are necessary to build an application, such as dialog and user interface technologies. Robust Speech Recognition in Embedded Systems and PC Applications is divided into five chapters. The first one reviews the main difficulties encountered in automatic speech recognition when the type of communication is unknown. The second chapter focuses on environment-independent/adaptive speech recognition approaches and on the mainstream methods applicable to noise robust speech recognition. The third chapter discusses several critical technologies that contribute to making an application usable. It also provides some design recommendations on how to design prompts, generate user feedback and develop speech user interfaces. The fourth chapter reviews several techniques that are particularly useful for embedded systems or to decrease computational complexity. It also presents some case studies for embedded applications and PC-based systems. Finally, the fifth chapter provides a future outlook for robust speech recognition, emphasizing the areas that the author sees as the most promising for the future. Robust Speech Recognition in Embedded Systems and PC Applications serves as a valuable reference and although not intended as a formal University textbook, contains some material that can be used for a course at the graduate or undergraduate level. It is a good complement for the book entitled Robustness in Automatic Speech Recognition: Fundamentals and Applications co-authored by the same author.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Information intermediation is the foundation stone of some of the most successful Internet companies, and is perhaps second only to the Internet Infrastructure companies. On the heels of information integration and interoperability, this book on information brokering discusses the next step in information interoperability and integration. The emerging Internet economy based on burgeoning B2B and B2C trading will soon demand semantics-based information intermediation for its feasibility and success. B2B ventures are involved in the `rationalization' of new vertical markets and construction of domain specific product catalogs. This book provides approaches for re-use of existing vocabularies and domain ontologies as a basis for this rationalization and provides a framework based on inter-ontology interoperation. Infrastructural trade-offs that identify optimizations in performance and scalability of web sites will soon give way to information based trade-offs as alternate rationalization schemes come into play and the necessity of interoperating across these schemes is realized. Information Brokering Across Heterogeneous Digital Data's intended readers are researchers, software architects and CTOs, advanced product developers dealing with information intermediation issues in the context of e-commerce (B2B and B2C), information technology professionals in various vertical markets (e.g., geo-spatial information, medicine, auto), and all librarians interested in information brokering.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Semantic Models for Multimedia Database Searching and Browsing begins with the introduction of multimedia information applications, the need for the development of the multimedia database management systems (MDBMSs), and the important issues and challenges of multimedia systems. The temporal relations, the spatial relations, the spatio-temporal relations, and several semantic models for multimedia information systems are also introduced. In addition, this book discusses recent advances in multimedia database searching and multimedia database browsing. More specifically, issues such as image/video segmentation, motion detection, object tracking, object recognition, knowledge-based event modeling, content-based retrieval, and key frame selections are presented for the first time in a single book. Two case studies consisting of two semantic models are included in the book to illustrate how to use semantic models to design multimedia information systems. Semantic Models for Multimedia Database Searching and Browsing is an excellent reference and can be used in advanced level courses for researchers, scientists, industry professionals, software engineers, students, and general readers who are interested in the issues, challenges, and ideas underlying the current practice of multimedia presentation, multimedia database searching, and multimedia browsing in multimedia information systems.</dcvalue>

Three HDLs are presented: VHDL and Verilog, the widely used standard languages, and the proprietary Altera HDL (AHDL). The chapters on these languages serve as tutorials and comparisons are made that show the strengths and weaknesses of each language. A large number of examples are used in the description of each language providing insight for the design and implementation of FPLDs.  With the addition of the Altera UP-1 prototyping board, all examples can be tested and verified in a real FPLD. Digital Systems Design and Prototyping: Using Field Programmable Logic and Hardware Description Languages, Second Edition is designed as an advanced level textbook as well as a reference for the professional engineer.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Chapter 1 places into perspective a total Information Storage and Retrieval System. This perspective introduces new challenges to the problems that need to be theoretically addressed and commercially implemented. Ten years ago commercial implementation of the algorithms being developed was not realistic, allowing theoreticians to limit their focus to very specific areas. Bounding a problem is still essential in deriving theoretical results. But the commercialization and insertion of this technology into systems like the Internet that are widely being used changes the way problems are bounded. From a theoretical perspective, efficient scalability of algorithms to systems with gigabytes and terabytes of data, operating with minimal user search statement information, and making maximum use of all functional aspects of an information system need to be considered. The dissemination systems using persistent indexes or mail files to modify ranking algorithms and combining the search of structured information fields and free text into a consolidated weighted output are examples of potential new areas of investigation. The best way for the theoretician or the commercial developer to understand the importance of problems to be solved is to place them in the context of a total vision of a complete system. Understanding the differences between Digital Libraries and Information Retrieval Systems will add an additional dimension to the potential future development of systems. The collaborative aspects of digital libraries can be viewed as a new source of information that dynamically could interact with information retrieval techniques.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Mobile Channel Characteristics introduces the principal transmission phenomena of mobile and personal communication - the ones that affect design of modems, channel simulators, smart antennas, and other system components at the physical level. It is designed to be accessible to senior undergraduates, as well as graduate students and working engineers. The treatment parallels mathematical derivations with intuitive explanations and simple approximations in order to develop the reader's understanding of the phenomena. Because of this strong tutorial flavor, the text is also suitable for those entering the area from a different academic discipline. Mobile Channel Characteristics was conceived and written as an interactive text to be viewed on a computer screen. It includes many features not found in conventional texts: The entire text resides on your hard drive. It is always ready, just a mouse-click away; It is a live document. Try different parameter values, and the equations, tables and graphs recalculate as you watch. Animated graphics illustrate dynamics of the channel. Explore propagation, modulation or system models interactively to gain additional insight; The examples and appendices are `tear-off design sheets'. You can use their programs on the job or in your thesis to speed up your work; It links you to the world. Hyperlinks connect you to websites of cited authors, to online research journals, and to employers and graduate schools, all through the Internet. Mobile Channel Characteristics includes working programs for three different methods of channel gain generation for fading channel simulation, as well as working programs to illustrate their use. Mobile Channel Characteristics is an essential reference tool for practising engineers, researchers, academics, and students. It is a self-study text equally suited for classroom use.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Multimedia data comprising of images, audio and video is becoming increasingly common. The decreasing costs of consumer electronic devices such as digital cameras and digital camcorders, along with the ease of transportation facilitated by the Internet, has lead to a phenomenal rise in the amount of multimedia data generated and distributed. Given that this trend of increased use of multimedia data is likely to accelerate, there is an urgent need for providing a clear means of capturing, storing, indexing, retrieving, analyzing and summarizing such data. Content-based access to multimedia data is of primary importance since it is the natural way by which human beings interact with such information. To facilitate the content-based access of multimedia information, the first step is to derive feature measures from these data so that a feature space representation of the data content can be formed. This can subsequently allow for mapping the feature space to the symbol space (semantics) either automatically or through human intervention. Thus, signal to symbol mapping, useful for any practical system, can be successfully achieved. Perspectives on Content-Based Multimedia Systems provides a comprehensive set of techniques to tackle these important issues. This book offers detailed solutions to a wide range of practical problems in building real systems by providing specifics of three systems built by the authors. While providing a systems focus, it also equips the reader with a keen understanding of the fundamental issues, including a formalism for content-based multimedia database systems, multimedia feature extraction, object-based techniques, signature-based techniques and fuzzy retrieval techniques. The performance evaluation issues of practical systems is also explained. This book brings together essential elements of building a content-based multimedia database system in a way that makes them accessible to practitioners in computer science and electrical engineering. It can also serve as a textbook for graduate-level courses.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">The architectural concept of a memory hierarchy has been immensely successful, making possible today's spectacular pace of technology evolution in both the volume of data and the speed of data access. Its success is difficult to understand, however, when examined within the traditional "memoryless" framework of performance analysis. The `memoryless' framework cannot properly reflect a memory hierarchy's ability to take advantage of patterns of data use that are transient. The Fractal Structure of Data Reference: Applications to the Memory Hierarchy both introduces, and justifies empirically, an alternative modeling framework in which arrivals are driven by a statistically self-similar underlying process, and are transient in nature. The substance of this book comes from the ability of the model to impose a mathematically tractable structure on important problems involving the operation and performance of a memory hierarchy. It describes events as they play out at a wide range of time scales, from the operation of file buffers and storage control cache, to a statistical view of entire disk storage applications. Striking insights are obtained about how memory hierarchies work, and how to exploit them to best advantage. The emphasis is on the practical application of such results. The Fractal Structure of Data Reference: Applications to the Memory Hierarchy will be of interest to professionals working in the area of applied computer performance and capacity planning, particularly those with a focus on disk storage. The book is also an excellent reference for those interested in database and data structure research.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">CMOS Memory Circuits is a systematic and comprehensive reference work designed to aid in the understanding of CMOS memory circuits, architectures, and design techniques. CMOS technology is the dominant fabrication method and almost the exclusive choice for semiconductor memory designers. Both the quantity and the variety of complementary-metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) memories are staggering. CMOS memories are traded as mass-products worldwide and are diversified to satisfy nearly all practical requirements in operational speed, power, size, and environmental tolerance. Without the outstanding speed, power, and packing density characteristics of CMOS memories, neither personal computing, nor space exploration, nor superior defense systems, nor many other feats of human ingenuity could be accomplished. Electronic systems need continuous improvements in speed performance, power consumption, packing density, size, weight, and costs. These needs continue to spur the rapid advancement of CMOS memory processing and circuit technologies. CMOS Memory Circuits is essential for those who intend to (1) understand, (2) apply, (3) design and (4) develop CMOS memories.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Coding and Modulation for Digital Television presents a comprehensive description of all error control coding and digital modulation techniques used in Digital Television (DTV). This book illustrates the relevant elements from the expansive theory of channel coding to how the transmission environment dictates the choice of error control coding and digital modulation schemes. These elements are presented in such a way that both the `mathematical integrity' and `understanding for engineers' are combined in a complete form and supported by a number of practical examples. In addition, the book contains descriptions of the existing standards and provides a valuable source of corresponding references. Coding and Modulation for Digital Television also features a description of the latest techniques, providing the reader with a glimpse of future digital broadcasting. These include the concepts of soft-in-soft-out decoding, turbo-coding and cross-correlated quadrature modulation, all of which will have a prominent future in improving efficiency of the next generation DTV systems. Coding and Modulation for Digital Television is essential reading for all undergraduate and postgraduate students, broadcasting and communication engineers, researchers, marketing managers, regulatory bodies, governmental organizations and standardization institutions of the digital television industry.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">“If you have built castles in the air, your work need not be lost; that is where they should be. Now put the foundations under them. ” - Henry David Thoreau, Walden Although engineering is a study entrenched firmly in belief of pr- matism, I have always believed its impact need not be limited to pr- matism. Pragmatism is not the boundaries that define engineering, just the (sometimes unforgiving) rules by which we sight our goals. This book studies two major problems of content-based video proce- ing for a media-based technology: Video Object Plane (VOP) Extr- tion and Representation, in support of the MPEG-4 and MPEG-7 video standards, respectively. After reviewing relevant image and video p- cessing techniques, we introduce the concept of Voronoi Ordered Spaces for both VOP extraction and representation to integrate shape infor- tion into low-level optimization algorithms and to derive robust shape descriptors, respectively. We implement a video object segmentation system with a novel surface optimization scheme that integrates Voronoi Ordered Spaces with existing techniques to balance visual information against predictions of models of a priori information. With these VOPs, we have explicit forms of video objects that give users the ability to - dress and manipulate video content. We outline a general methodology of robust data representation and comparison through the concept of complex partitioning mapped onto Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs).</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">The modern wireless communication industry has put great demands on circuit designers for smaller, cheaper transceivers in the gigahertz frequency range. One tool which has assisted designers in satisfying these requirements is the use of on-chip inductiveelements (inductors and transformers) in silicon (Si) radio-frequency (RF) integrated circuits (ICs). These elements allow greatly improved levels of performance in Si monolithic low-noise amplifiers, power amplifiers, up-conversion and down-conversion mixers and local oscillators. Inductors can be used to improve the intermodulation distortion performance and noise figure of small-signal amplifiers and mixers. In addition, the gain of amplifier stages can be enhanced and the realization of low-cost on-chip local oscillators with good phase noise characteristics is made feasible. In order to reap these benefits, it is essential that the IC designer be able to predict and optimize the characteristics of on-chip inductiveelements. Accurate knowledge of inductance values, quality factor (Q) and the influence of ad- cent elements (on-chip proximity effects) and substrate losses is essential. In this book the analysis, modeling and application of on-chip inductive elements is considered. Using analyses based on Maxwells equations, an accurate and efficient technique is developed to model these elements over a wide frequency range. Energy loss to the conductive substrate is modeled through several mechanisms, including electrically induced displacement and conductive c- rents and by magnetically induced eddy currents. These techniques have been compiled in a user-friendly software tool ASITIC (Analysis and Simulation of Inductors and Transformers for Integrated Circuits).</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">The modern electronic testing has a forty year history. Test professionals hold some fairly large conferences and numerous workshops, have a journal, and there are over one hundred books on testing. Still, a full course on testing is offered only at a few universities, mostly by professors who have a research interest in this area. Apparently, most professors would not have taken a course on electronic testing when they were students. Other than the computer engineering curriculum being too crowded, the major reason cited for the absence of a course on electronic testing is the lack of a suitable textbook. For VLSI the foundation was provided by semiconductor device techn- ogy, circuit design, and electronic testing. In a computer engineering curriculum, therefore, it is necessary that foundations should be taught before applications. The field of VLSI has expanded to systems-on-a-chip, which include digital, memory, and mixed-signalsubsystems. To our knowledge this is the first textbook to cover all three types of electronic circuits. We have written this textbook for an undergraduate “foundations” course on electronic testing. Obviously, it is too voluminous for a one-semester course and a teacher will have to select from the topics. We did not restrict such freedom because the selection may depend upon the individual expertise and interests. Besides, there is merit in having a larger book that will retain its usefulness for the owner even after the completion of the course. With equal tenacity, we address the needs of three other groups of readers.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Karlheinz Brandenburg and Mark Kahrs With the advent of multimedia, digital signal processing (DSP) of sound has emerged from the shadow of bandwidth limited speech processing. Today, the main appli cations of audio DSP are high quality audio coding and the digital generation and manipulation of music signals. They share common research topics including percep tual measurement techniques and analysis/synthesis methods. Smaller but nonetheless very important topics are hearing aids using signal processing technology and hardware architectures for digital signal processing of audio. In all these areas the last decade has seen a significant amount of application oriented research. The topics covered here coincide with the topics covered in the biannual work shop on “Applications of Signal Processing to Audio and Acoustics”. This event is sponsored by the IEEE Signal Processing Society (Technical Committee on Audio and Electroacoustics) and takes place at Mohonk Mountain House in New Paltz, New York. A short overview of each chapter will illustrate the wide variety of technical material presented in the chapters of this book. John Beerends: Perceptual Measurement Techniques. The advent of perceptual measurement techniques is a byproduct of the advent of digital coding for both speech and high quality audio signals. Traditional measurement schemes are bad estimates for the subjective quality after digital coding/decoding. Listening tests are subject to sta tistical uncertainties and the basic question of repeatability in a different environment.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">An exciting new development has taken place in the digital era that has captured the imagination and talent of researchers around the globe - wavelet image compression. This technology has deep roots in theories of vision, and promises performance improvements over all other compression methods, such as those based on Fourier transforms, vectors quantizers, fractals, neural nets, and many others. It is this revolutionary new technology that is presented in Wavelet Image and Video Compression, in a form that is accessible to the largest audience possible. Wavelet Image and Video Compression is divided into four parts. Part I, Background Material, introduces the basic mathematical structures that underly image compression algorithms with the intention of providing an easy introduction to the mathematical concepts that are prerequisites for the remainder of the book. It explains such topics as change of bases, scalar and vector quantization, bit allocation and rate-distortion theory, entropy coding, the discrete-cosine transform, wavelet filters and other related topics. Part II, Still Image Coding, presents a spectrum of wavelet still image coding techniques. Part III, Special Topics in Still Image Coding, provides a variety of example coding schemes with a special flavor in either approach or application domain. Part IV, Video Coding, examines wavelet and pyramidal coding techniques for video data. Wavelet Image and Video Compression serves as an excellent reference and may be used as a text for advanced courses covering the subject.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">The Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM) is undoubtedly the most successful second generation digital mobile radio system. One of the key factors for this exceptional performance is the constant evolution of the GSM systems and its derivatives DCS-1800 and PCS-1900. The objective of the book is to address new concepts in the GSM system, dealing with both standardised features as well as theoretically and technologically feasible improvements, which contribute to evolutionary changes in general. Dynamic evolution of GSM presents a platform for the Universal Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS) introduction and major trends in UMTS development will be addressed in this book, in particular progress towards new radio interface. The book is the collection of individual contributions from a number of authors. The intention of the editors was to gather the most prominent specialist in the GSM area. Ongoing efforts in GSM standardisation are focused on Phase 2+ with items planned to be added gradually on demand. Being mostly independent of each other, each of them could be introduced with little impact on the rest of the system. Speech remains the prime service of cellular systems with ongoing work on spectral efficiency taking into account the trade-off between cost of the system and transmission quality. Most notable result from novel speech service implementations is the introduction of new Enhanced Full Rate (EFR) speech coder. International railway organisation (Union Internationale des Chemins de Fer - UIC) has influenced the development of Advanced Speech Call Items (ASCI).</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Wavelet and subband transforms have been of great interest in the fields of - gineering and applied mathematics. The theories of these powerful signal p- cessing tools have matured and many applications utilizing them are emerging in different disciplines. This book, comprised of eleven chapter contributions from prominent researchers in the field, focuses on communications and mul- media applications of wavelet and subband transforms. The first six chapters of this book deal with a variety of communications applications that significantly benefit from wavelet and subband theories. S- ilarly, the remaining five chapters present recent advances in multimedia - plications of wavelet and subband transforms. These chapters interconnect the requirements of applications with the underlying theory and their engineering solutions. Hence, the reader can easily trace the entire path from fundamentals to the purpose and merit of application in hand. A combined list of references for the entire volume is given at the end of the text that should be helpful to the interested reader for a further study. This book is anticipated to be of particular interest to engineers and sci- tists who want to learn about state-of-the-art subband and wavelet transform applications as well as their theoretical underpinnings. It can also serve as a supplementary book for graduate level engineering and applied mathematics courses on wavelet and subband transforms.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">From a review of the Second Edition 'If you are new to the field and want to know what "all this Verilog stuff is about," you've found the golden goose. The text here is straight forward, complete, and example rich -mega-multi-kudos to the author James Lee. Though not as detailed as the Verilog reference guides from Cadence, it likewise doesn't suffer from the excessive abstractness those make you wade through. This is a quick and easy read, and will serve as a desktop reference for as long as Verilog lives.

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">It is hardly a profound observation to note that we remain in the midst of a wireless revolution. In 1998 alone, over 150 million cell phones were sold worldwide, representing an astonishing 50% increase over the previous year. Maintaining such a remarkable growth rate requires constant innovation to decrease cost while increasing performance and functionality. Traditionally, wireless products have depended on a mixture of semicond- tor technologies, spanning GaAs, bipolar and BiCMOS, just to name a few. A question that has been hotly debated is whether CMOS could ever be suitable for RF applications. However, given the acknowledged inferiority of CMOS transistors relative to those in other candidate technologies, it has been argued by many that “CMOS RF” is an oxymoron, an endeavor best left cloistered in the ivory towers of academia. In rebuttal, there are several compelling reasons to consider CMOS for wi- less applications. Aside from the exponential device and density improvements delivered regularly by Moore’s law, only CMOS offers a technology path for integrating RF and digital elements, potentially leading to exceptionally c- pact and low-cost devices. To enable this achievement, several thorny issues need to be resolved. Among these are the problem of poor passive com- nents, broadband noise in MOSFETs, and phase noise in oscillators made with CMOS. Beyond the component level, there is also the important question of whether there are different architectural choices that one would make if CMOS were used, given the different constraints.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Circuit simulation is essential in integrated circuit design, and the accuracy of circuit simulation depends on the accuracy of the transistor model. BSIM3v3 (BSIM for Berkeley Short-channel IGFET Model) has been selected as the first MOSFET model for standardization by the Compact Model Council, a consortium of leading companies in semiconductor and design tools. In the next few years, many fabless and integrated semiconductor companies are expected to switch from dozens of other MOSFET models to BSIM3. This will require many device engineers and most circuit designers to learn the basics of BSIM3. MOSFET Modeling &amp; BSIM3 User's Guide explains the detailed physical effects that are important in modeling MOSFETs, and presents the derivations of compact model expressions so that users can understand the physical meaning of the model equations and parameters. It is the first book devoted to BSIM3. It treats the BSIM3 model in detail as used in digital, analog and RF circuit design. It covers the complete set of models, i.e., I-V model, capacitance model, noise model, parasitics model, substrate current model, temperature effect model and non quasi-static model. MOSFET Modeling &amp; BSIM3 User's Guide not only addresses the device modeling issues but also provides a user's guide to the device or circuit design engineers who use the BSIM3 model in digital/analog circuit design, RF modeling, statistical modeling, and technology prediction. This book is written for circuit designers and device engineers, as well as device scientists worldwide. It is also suitable as a reference for graduate courses and courses in circuit design or device modelling. Furthermore, it can be used as a textbook for industry courses devoted to BSIM3. MOSFET Modeling &amp; BSIM3 User's Guide is comprehensive and practical. It is balanced between the background information and advanced discussion of BSIM3. It is helpful to experts and students alike.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Rapid Prototyping of Digital Systems provides an exciting and challenging laboratory component for undergraduate digital logic and computer design courses. The more advanced topics and exercises also make this text useful for upper level courses in digital logic or programmable logic. Design engineers working in industry will want to consider this text for a rapid introduction to PPLD technology and logic synthesis using commercial CAD tools. Rapid Prototyping of Digital Systems includes two tutorials on the Altera CAD tool environment, an overview of programmable logic, and a design library with several easy-to-use input and output functions. These features were developed to help students get started quickly. Early design examples use schematic capture and library components. VHDL is used for more complex designs after a short introduction to VHDL-based synthesis. The approach used in this text reflects contemporary practice in industry more accurately than the more traditional TTL protoboard-based laboratory courses. Designs containing up to twenty thousand gates are possible with the Altera Student Version CAD tools and the UP 1 board. Rapid Prototyping of Digital Systems contains a number of interesting and challenging laboratory projects involving serial communications, state machines with video output, video games and graphics, simple computers, keyboard and mouse interfaces, robotics, and a RISC processor core. These projects were all developed on the student version of the Altera CAD tools and can be implemented on the Altera UP 1 board.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Among analog-to-digital converters, the delta-sigma modulator has cornered the market on high to very high resolution converters at moderate speeds, with typical applications such as digital audio and instrumentation. Interest has recently increased in delta-sigma circuits built with a continuous-time loop filter rather than the more common switched-capacitor approach. Continuous-time delta-sigma modulators offer less noisy virtual ground nodes at the input, inherent protection against signal aliasing, and the potential to use a physical rather than an electrical integrator in the first stage for novel applications like accelerometers and magnetic flux sensors. More significantly, they relax settling time restrictions so that modulator clock rates can be raised. This opens the possibility of wideband (1 MHz or more) converters, possibly for use in radio applications at an intermediate frequency so that one or more stages of mixing might be done in the digital domain. Continuous-Time Delta-Sigma Modulators for High-Speed A/D Conversion: Theory, Practice and Fundamental Performance Limits covers all aspects of continuous-time delta-sigma modulator design, with particular emphasis on design for high clock speeds. The authors explain the ideal design of such modulators in terms of the well-understood discrete-time modulator design problem and provide design examples in Matlab. They also cover commonly-encountered non-idealities in continuous-time modulators and how they degrade performance, plus a wealth of material on the main problems (feedback path delays, clock jitter, and quantizer metastability) in very high-speed designs and how to avoid them. They also give a concrete design procedure for a real high-speed circuit which illustrates the tradeoffs in the selection of key parameters. Detailed circuit diagrams, simulation results and test results for an integrated continuous-time 4 GHz band-pass modulator for A/D conversion of 1 GHz analog signals are also presented. Continuous-Time Delta-Sigma Modulators for High-Speed A/D Conversion: Theory, Practice and Fundamental Performance Limits concludes with some promising modulator architectures and a list of the challenges that remain in this exciting field.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">The protection of sensitive information against unauthorized access or fraudulent changes has been of prime concern throughout the centuries. Modern communication techniques, using computers connected through networks, make all data even more vulnerable for these threats. Also, new issues have come up that were not relevant before, e. g. how to add a (digital) signature to an electronic document in such a way that the signer can not deny later on that the document was signed by him/her. Cryptology addresses the above issues. It is at the foundation of all information security. The techniques employed to this end have become increasingly mathematical of nature. This book serves as an introduction to modern cryptographic methods. After a brief survey of classical cryptosystems, it concentrates on three main areas. First of all, stream ciphers and block ciphers are discussed. These systems have extremely fast implementations, but sender and receiver have to share a secret key. Public key cryptosystems (the second main area) make it possible to protect data without a prearranged key. Their security is based on intractable mathematical problems, like the factorization of large numbers. The remaining chapters cover a variety of topics, such as zero-knowledge proofs, secret sharing schemes and authentication codes. Two appendices explain all mathematical prerequisites in great detail. One is on elementary number theory (Euclid's Algorithm, the Chinese Remainder Theorem, quadratic residues, inversion formulas, and continued fractions). The other appendix gives a thorough introduction to finite fields and their algebraic structure.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Design and Analysis of Integrator-Based Log-Domain Filter Circuits deals with the design and analysis of log-domain filter circuits. It describes several synthesis methods that aid the designer in developing bipolar or BiCMOS filter circuits with cut-off frequencies ranging from the low kilohertz range to several hundreds of megahertz. Filter response deviations due to transistor-level nonidealities are systematically analyzed, leading to effective electronic compensation schemes. Numerous examples are provided in the text with measured experimental data from IC prototypes. Design and Analysis of Integrator-Based Log-Domain Filter Circuits is intended for engineers in research or development, as well as advanced-level engineering students. Extensive discussion on filter text metrics should also interest engineers who are responsible for testing high-performance, high-speed analog or mixed-signal products.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Fluorescence spectroscopy and its applications to the physical and life sciences have evolved rapidly during the past decade. The increased interest in fluorescence appears to be due to advances in time resolution, methods of data analysis, and improved instrumentation. With these advances, it is now practical to perform time-resolved measurements with enough resolution to compare the results with the structural and dynamic features of mac- molecules, to probe the structures of proteins, membranes, and nucleic acids, and to acquire two-dimensional microscopic images of chemical or protein distributions in cell cultures. Advances in laser and detector technology have also resulted in renewed interest in fluorescence for clinical and analytical chemistry. Because of these numerous developments and the rapid appearance of new methods, it has become difficult to remain current on the science of fluorescence and its many applications. Consequently, I have asked the experts in particular areas of fluorescence to summarize their knowledge and the current state of the art. This has resulted in the initial two volumes of Topics in Fluorescence Spectroscopy, which is intended to be an ongoing series which summarizes, in one location, the vast literature on fluorescence spectroscopy. The third volume will appear shortly. The first three volumes are designed to serve as an advanced text. These volumes describe the more recent techniques and technologies (Volume 1), the principles governing fluorescence and the experimental observables (Volume 2), and applications in biochemistry and biophysics (Volume 3).</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy is widely used as a research tool in bioch- istry and biophysics. These uses of fluorescence have resulted in extensive knowledge of the structure and dynamics of biological macromolecules. This information has been gained by studies of phenomena that affect the excited state, such as the local environment, quenching processes, and energy transfer. Topics in Fluorescence Spectroscopy, Volume 4: Probe Design and Chemical Sensing reflects a new trend, which is the use of time-resolved fluorescence in analytical and clinical chemistry. These emerging applications of time-resolved fluorescence are the result of continued advances in laser detector and computer technology. For instance, pho- multiplier tubes (PMT) were previously bulky devices. Miniature PMTs are now available, and the performance of simpler detectors is continually improving. There is also considerable effort to develop fluorophores that can be excited with the red/ne- infrared (NIR) output of laser diodes. Using such probes, one can readily imagine small time-resolved fluorometers, even hand-held devices, being used fordoctor’s office or home health care.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">This volume presents five pedagogical articles spanning frontier developments in contemporary nuclear physics ranging from the physics of a single nucleon to nucleosynthesis in the Big Bang. Although the objectives of Advances in Nuclear Physics have been and will continue to be quite distinct from those of conventional conference proceedings, the articles in this volume are carefully edited and expanded manuscripts based on an outstanding series of lectures delivered at the VI J. A. Swieca Summer School in Brazil. Starting at the smallest scale, the first article by Dan Olof Riska addresses realistic chiral symmetric models of the nucleon. Since the analytic tools are not yet developed to solve nonperturbative QCD directly, significant effort has been devoted in recent years to the development of models which incorporate and are constrained by the approximate chiral symmetry manifested in QCD. This article provides a clear introduction to chiral symmetry and the Skyrme model, and discusses the Skyrme model’s relation to the chiral bag model, its extensions, and its application to nucleons and hyperons.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">This volume of Advances in Nuclear Physics addresses two very different frontiers of contemporary nuclear physics — one highly theoretical and the other solidly phenomenological. The first article by Matthias Burkardt provides a pedagogical overview of the timely topic of light front quantization. Although introduced decades ago by Dirac, light front quantization has been a central focus in theoretical - clear and particle physics in recent years for two majorreasons. The first, as discussed in detail by Burkardt, is that light-cone coordinates are the natural coordinates for describing high-energy scattering. The wealth of data in recent years on nucleon and nucleus structure functions from high-energy lepton and hadron scattering thus provides a strong impetus for understanding QCD on the light cone. Second, as theorists have explored light front quantization, a host of deep and intriguing theoretical questions have arisen associated with the triviality of the vacuum, the role of zero modes, rotational invariance, and renormalization. These issues are so compelling that they are now intensively investigated on their own merit, independent of the particular application to high-energy scattering. This article provides an excellent introduction and overview of the motivation from high-energy scattering, an accessible - scription of the basic ideas, an insightful discussion of the open problems, and a helpful guide to the specialized literature. It is an ideal opportunity for those with a spectator’s acquaintance to develop a deeper understanding of this important field.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Fluorescence spectroscopy continues its advance to more sophisticated methods and applications. As one looks over the previous decades, its appears that the first practical instruments for time-resolved measurements appeared in the 1970’s. The instrumentation and analysis methods for time-resolved fluorescence advanced rapidly throughout the 1980’s. Since 1990 we have witnessed a rapid migration of the principles of time-resolved fluorescence to cell biology and clinical appli- tions. Most recently, we have seen the introduction of multi-photon excitation, pump-probe and stimulated emission methods for studies of biological mac- molecules and for cellular imaging. These advanced topics are the subject of the present volume. Two-photon excitation was first predicted by Maria Goppert-Mayer in 1931, but was not experimentally observed until 1961. Observation of two-photon excitation required the introduction of lasers which provided adequate photon density for multi-photon absorption. Since the early observations of two-photon excitation in the 1960s, multi-photon spectroscopy has been limited to somewhat exotic applications of chemical physics, where it is used to study the electronic symmetry of small molecules. Placing one’s self back in 1980, it would be hard to imagine the use of multi-photon excitation in biophysics or cellular imaging.</dcvalue>

This book contains papers presented at the Traverse City conference. The book focuses on: atomic processes, step structure and dynamics; and their effect on surface and interface structures and on the relaxation kinetics of larger leng- scale nonequilibrium morphologies.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">We present here the second issue devoted entirely to the spin-labeling technique as part of Biological Magnetic Resonance. Volume 14 commemorates a modifi- tion in our editorial policy with the retirement of my esteemed coeditor, Jacques Reuben. From thisjuncture into the future, each issue will focus on some special topic in magnetic resonance. Each volume will be organized in most cases by guest editors, for example forthcoming issues will address the following topics: in vivo magnetic resonance (P. Robitaille and L. J. Berliner, eds. ) Modern techniques in proton NMR ofproteins (R. Krishna and L. J. Berliner, eds. ) Instrumental techniques of EPR (C. Bender and L. J. Berliner, eds. ) Thecurrent volume, Spin Labeling: The NextMillennium, presents an excellent collection of techniques and applications that evolved during the past decade since the last volume, volume 8 (1989). Someobvious omissions, such as multiquantum EPR and very high-frequency FT-ESR were unfortunately not possible for this volume. Perhaps they will appear in Spin Labeling: 2001. Lastly it is a pleasure to honor two scientists whose contributions were both pioneering and pivotal to the spin label technique: Professor Eduard G. Rozantsev (Moscow), whose synthetic feats in nitroxyl chemistry set the broad stage for a versatile catalog of labels; and Professor Harden M. McConnell, last year's Int- national ESR (EPR) Society Gold Medalist, who conceived and developed the spin label technique to address many biological problems (proteins, enzymes, m- branes, cells, immune response, etc. ).

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">The three articles of the present volume pertain to very different subjects, all ofconsiderable current interest. The first reviews the fascinating history ofthe search for nucleon substructure in the nucleus using the strength ofGamow– Teller excitations. The second deals with deep inelastic lepton scattering as a probe ofthe non-perturbative structure of the nucleon. The third describes the present state ofaffairs for muon catalyzed fusion, an application of nuclear physics which many new experiments have helped to elucidate. This volume certainly illustrates the broad range ofphysics within our field. The article on Nucleon Charge-Exchange Reactions at Intermediate Energy, by Parker Alford and Brian Spicer, reviews recent data which has clarified one of the greatest puzzles of nuclear physics during the past two decades, namely, the “missing strength” in Gamow–Teller (GT) transitions. The nucleon-nucleon interaction contains a GT component which has a low-lying giant resonance. The integrated GT strength is subject to a GT sum rule. Early experiments with (n,p) charge exchange reactions found only about half of the strength, required by the sum rule, in the vicinity of the giant resonance. At the time, new theoretical ideas suggested that the GT strength was especially sensitive to renormalization from effects pertaining to nucleon substructure, particularly the delta excitation of the nucleon in the nucleus.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">This book contains contributions to the 172. WE-Heraeus-Seminar “Atoms and Molecules in Strong External Fields,” which took place April 7–11 1997 at the Phys- zentrum Bad Honnef (Germany). The designation “strong fields” applies to external static magnetic, and/or electric fields that are sufficiently intense to cause alterations in the atomic or molecular str- ture and dynamics. The specific topics treated are the behavior and properties of atoms in strong static fields, the fundamental aspects and electronic structure of molecules in strong magnetic fields, the dynamics and aspects of chaos in highly excited R- berg atoms in external fields, matter in the atmosphere of astrophysical objects (white dwarfs, neutron stars), and quantum nanostructures in strong magnetic fields. It is obvious that the elaboration of the corresponding properties in these regimes causes the greatest difficulties, and is incomplete even today. Present-day technology has made it possible for many research groups to study the behavior of matter in strong external fields, both experimentally and theore- cally, where the phrase “experimentally” includes the astronomical observations. - derstanding these systems requires the development of modern theories and powerful computational techniques. Interdisciplinary collaborations will be helpful and useful in developing more efficient methods to understand these important systems. Hence the idea was to bring together people from different fields like atomic and molecular physics, theoretical chemistry, astrophysics and all those colleagues interested in aspects of few-body systems in external fields.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Quantum field theory is one of most central constructions in 20th century th- retical physics, and it continues to develop rapidly in many different directions. The aim of the workshop “New Developments in Quantum Field Theory”, which was held in Zakopane, Poland, June 14-20, 1997, was to capture a broad selection of the most recent advances in this field. The conference was sponsored by the Scientific and - vironmental Affairs Division of NATO, as part of the Advanced Research Workshop series. This book contains the proceedings of that meeting. Major topics covered at the workshop include quantized theories of gravity, string theory, conformal field theory, cosmology, field theory approaches to critical phenomena and the renormalization group, matrix models, and field theory techniques applied to the theory of turbulence. One common theme at the conference was the use of large-Nmatrix models to obtain exact results in a variety of different disciplines. For example, it has been known for several years that by taking a suitable double-scaling limit, certain string theories (or two-dimensional quantum gravity coupled to matter) can be re-obtained from the large-Nexpansion of matrix models. There continues to be a large activity in this area of research, which was well reflected by talks given at our workshop. Remarkably, large- Nmatrix models have very recently – just a few months before our meeting – been shown to have yet another deep relation to string theory.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">This book resulted from the NATO Advanced Research Workshop on “Electron Kinetics and Applications of Glow Discharges,” held in St. Petersburg, Russia, on May 19-23, 1997. Glow discharges have found widespread applications in many technological processes from the manufacture of semiconductors, to recent developments in na- technology, to the traditional fields of gas lasers, and discharge lamps. Consequently, the interest in the physics of glow discharges has experienced yet another resurgence of interest. While the non-equilibrium character of glow discharges is widely accepted, the opinion still prevails that the main features can be captured by fluid models, and that kinetic treatments are only required for the understanding of subtle details. The erroneousness of this belief is demonstrated by the failure of fluid models to describe many basic features of glow discharges such as, for instance, electrode phenomena, striations, and collisionless heating effects. An adequate description of glow discharges thus has to be of kinetic nature.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">This series of books, which is published at the rate of about one per year, addresses fundamental problems in materials science. The contents cover a broad range of topics from small clusters of atoms to engineering materials and involve chemistry, physics, materials science and engineering, with length scales ranging from Ångstroms up to millimeters. The emphasis is on basic science rather than on applications. Each book focuses on a single area of current interest and brings together leading experts to give an up-to-date discussion of their work and the work of others. Each article contains enough references that the interested reader can access the relevant literature. Thanks are given to the Center for Fundamental Materials Research at Michigan State University for supporting this series. M.F. Thorpe, Series Editor E-mail: thorpe @ pa.msu.edu East Lansing, Michigan PREFACE One of the most challenging problems in the study of structure is to characterize the atomic short-range order in materials. Long-range order can be determined with a high degree of accuracy by analyzing Bragg peak positions and intensities in data from single crystals or powders. However, information about short-range order is contained in the diffuse scattering intensity. This is difficult to analyze because it is low in absolute intensity (though the integrated intensity may be significant) and widely spread in reciprocal space.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">The field of nonlinear optics, which has undergone a very rapid development since the discovery of lasers in the early sixties, continues to be an active and rapidly developing - search area. The interest is mainly due to the potential applications of nonlinear optics: - rectly in telecommunications for high rate data transmission, image processing and recognition or indirectly from the possibility of obtaining large wavelength range tuneable lasers for applications in industry, medicine, biology, data storage and retrieval, etc. New phenomena and materials continue to appear regularly, renewing the field. This has proven to be especially true over the last five years. New materials such as organics have been developed with very large second- and third-order nonlinear optical responses. Imp- tant developments in the areas of photorefractivity, all optical phenomena, frequency conv- sion and electro-optics have been observed. In parallel, a number of new phenomena have been reported, some of them challenging the previously held concepts. For example, solitons based on second-order nonlinearities have been observed in photorefractive materials and frequency doubling crystals, destroying the perception that third order nonlinearities are - quired for their generation and propagation. New ways of creating and manipulating nonl- ear optical materials have been developed. An example is the creation of highly nonlinear (second-order active) polymers by static electric field, photo-assisted or all-optical poling. Nonlinear optics involves, by definition, the product of electromagnetic fields. As a con- quence, it leads to the beam control.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Since the discovery in 1986 of high temperature superconductors by J. G. Bednorz and K. A. Müller, a considerable progress has been made and several important scientific problems have emerged. Within this NATO Advanced Study Institute our intention was to focus mainly on the controversial topic of the symmetry of the superconducting gap and given the very short coherence length, the role of fluctuations. The Institute on ‘The Gap Symmetry and Fluctuations in High- Superconductors’ took place in the “Institut d’Etudes Scientifiques de Cargèse” in Corsica, France, between 1 - 13 September 1997. The 110 participantsfrom 18 countries (yet 30 nationalities) including 23 full time lecturers, have spent two memorable weeks in this charming Mediterranean resort. All lecturers were asked to prepare pedagogical papers to clearly present the central physical idea behind specific model or experiment. The better understanding of physics of high temperature superconductivity is certainly needed to guide the development of applications of these materials in high and weak current devices.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">In 1987 a major breakthrough occurred in materials science. A new family of materials was discovered that became superconducting above the temperature at which nitrogen gas liquifies, namely, 77 K or –196°C. Within months of the discovery, a wide variety of experimental techniques were brought to bear in order to measure the properties of these materials and to gain an understanding of why they superconduct at such high temperatures. Among the techniques used were electromagnetic absorption in both the normal and the superconducting states. The measurements enabled the determination of a wide variety of properties, and in some instances led to the observation of new effects not seen by other measu- ments, such as the existence of weak-link microwave absorption at low dc magnetic fields. The number of different properties and the degree of detail that can be obtained from magnetic field- and temperature-dependent studies of electromagnetic abso- tion are not widely appreciated. For example, these measurements can provide information on the band gap, critical fields, the H–T irreversibility line, the amount of trapped flux, and even information about the symmetry of the wave function of the Cooper pairs. It is possible to use low dc magnetic field-induced absorption of microwaves with derivative detection to verify the presence of superconductivity in a matter of minutes, and the measurements are often more straightforward than others. For example, they do not require the physical contact with the sample that is necessary when using four-probe resistivity to detect superconductivity.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">The International Conference on Strongly Coupled Coulomb Systems was held on the campus of Boston College in Newton, Massachusetts, August 3–10, 1997. Although this conference was the first under a new name, it was the continuation of a series of international meetings on strongly coupled plasmas and other Coulomb systems that started with the NATO Summer Institute on Strongly Coupled Plasmas, almost exactly twenty years prior to this conference, in July of 1977 in Orleans la Source, France. Over the intervening period the field of strongly coupled plasmas has developed vigorously. In the 1977 meeting the emphasis was on computer (Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics) simulations which provided, for the first time, insight into the rich and new physics of strongly coupled fully ionizedplasmas. While theorists scrambled to provide a theoretical underpinning for these results, there was also a dearth of real experimental input to reinforce the computer simulations. Over the past few years this situation has changed drastically and a variety of direct experiments on classical, pure, strongly correlated plasma systems (charged particle traps, dusty plasmas, electrons on the surface of liquid helium, etc. ) have become available. Even more importantly, entire new area of experimental interest in condensed matter physics have opened up through developments in nano-technology and the fabrication of low-dimensional systems, where the physical behavior, in many ways, is similar to that in classical plasmas. Strongly coupled plasma physics has always been an interdisciplinaryactivity.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Although rigidity has been studied since the time of Lagrange (1788) and Maxwell (1864), it is only in the last twenty-five years that it has begun to find applications in the basic sciences. The modern era starts with Laman (1970), who made the subject rigorous in two dimensions, followed by the development of computer algorithms that can test over a million sites in seconds and find the rigid regions, and the associated pivots, leading to many applications. This workshop was organized to bring together leading researchers studying the underlying theory, and to explore the various areas of science where applications of these ideas are being implemented.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">This series of books, which is published at the rate of about one per year, addresses fundamental problems in materials science. The contents cover a broad range of topics from small clusters of atoms to engineering materials and involves chemistry, physics, materials science and engineering, with length scales ranging from Ångstroms up to millimeters. The emphasis is on basic science rather than on applications. Each book focuses on a single area of current interest and brings together leading experts to give an up to date discussion of their work and the work of others. Each article contains enough references that the interested reader can access the relevant literature. Thanks are given to the Center for Fundamental Materials Research at Michigan State University for supporting this series. M. F. Thorpe, Series Editor E mail: thorpe@pa. msu. edu V PREFACE This book records invited lectures given at the workshop on Physics of Manganites, held at Michigan State University, July 26 29, 1998. Doped manganites are an interesting class of compounds that show both metal insulator and ferromagnetic to paramagnetic transitions at the same temperature. This was discovered in the early 1950s by Jonker and van Santen and basic theoretical ideas were developed by Zener (1951), Anderson and Hasegawa (1955), and deGennes (1960) to explain these transitions and related interesting observations.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Down comes a deluge of sonorous hail, Or prone-descending rain. Wide-rent, the clouds Pour a whole flood, and yet, its flame unquenched, Th’unconquerable lightning struggles through. Ragged and fierce, or in red whirling balls, And fires the mountains with redoubled rage. Black from the stroke, above, the smould’ring pine Stands a sad shattered trunk; and, stretched below, A lifeless group the blasted cattle lie. James Thompson, “The Seasons” (1727) have been investigating ball lightning for more than two decades. I published a ball lightning report in Nature in 1976 that received worldwide publicity and I consequently many people wrote to me with accounts of their own experiences. Within a very short time, I had accumulated about 200 firsthand accounts, and the file has continued to grow steadily since then. Several things impressed me. Few of those who wrote to me had any detailed foreknowledge of ball lightning at the time of their observation. Nonetheless, once reports of other phenomena such as St. Elmo’s fire had been eliminated, the remaining descriptions were remarkably consistent. Furthermore, nearly all who contacted me were keen to have an explanation of what they had seen and seemed entirely sincere.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Justbefore the preliminary programof Orbis Scientiae 1998 went to press the news in physics was suddenly dominated by the discovery that neutrinos are, after all, massive particles. This was predicted by some physicists including Dr. Behram Kusunoglu, who had apaper published on this subject in 1976 in the Physical Review. Massive neutrinos do not necessarily simplify the physics of elementary particles but they do give elementary particle physics a new direction. If the dark matter content ofthe universe turns out to consist ofneutrinos, the fact that they are massive should make an impact on cosmology. Some of the papers in this volume have attempted to provide answers to these questions. We have a long way to go before we find the real reasons for nature’s creation of neutrinos. Another neutrino-related event was the passing of their discoverer, Fredrick Reines: The trustees of the Global Foundation, members of the Orbis Scientiae 1998, dedicate this conference to Fredrick Reines of the University of California at Irvine. The late Professor Reines was a loyal and active member of these series of conferences on the frontiers of physics and cosmology since 1964. He also sewed as one of the trustees of the Global Foundation for the past three years. Professor Reines discovered the most elusive particle, the neutrino, in 1954. We are proud to say that we recognized the importance of this discovery by awarding him the J.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">The Foundation for Advances in Medicine and Science (FAMS), the organizers of SCANNING 98, sponsored its third annual Atomic Force Microscopy/Scanning Tunneling Microscopy Symposium at the Omni Inner Harbor Hotelin Baltimore, Maryland, from May 9 to 12, 1998. This book represents the compilation of papers that were presented at the AFM/STM Symposium as well as a few that were presented at SCANNING 96 and SCANNING 97 meetings that took place in Monterey, California. The purpose of the symposium was to provide an interface between scientists and engineers, representatives of industry, government and academia, all of whom have a common interest in probe microscopies. The meetings offered an ideal forum where ideas could easily be exchanged and where individuals from diverse fields who are on the cutting edge ofprobe microscopy research could communicate with one another. Experts in probe microscopy from around the world representing a wide range of disciplines including physics, biotechnology, nanotechnology, chemistry, material science, etc., were invited to participate. The format of the meeting was structured so as to encourage communication among these individuals. During the first day’s sessions papers were presented on general topics such as application of scanning probe microscopy in materials science; STM and scanning tunneling spectroscopy of organic materials; fractal analysis in AFM; and nanomanipulation. Other papers presented included unexpected ordering of a molecule; synthesis ofpeptides and oligonucleotides; and analysis oflunar soils from Apollo 11.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">This series of books, which is published at the rate of about one per year, addresses fundamental problems in materials science. The contents cover a broad range of topics from small clusters of atoms to engineering materials and involve chemistry, physics, materials science, and engineering, with length scales ranging from Ångstroms up to millimeters. The emphasis is on basic science rather than on applications. Each book focuses on a single area of current interest and brings together leading experts to give an up-to-date discussion of their work and the work of others. Each article contains enough references that the interested reader can access the relevant literature. Thanks are given to the Center for Fundamental Materials Research at Michigan State University for supporting this series. M. F. Thorpe, Series Editor E-mail: thorpe@pa. msu. edu East Lansing, Michigan V PREFACE It is hard to believe that not quite ten years ago, namely in 1991, nanotubes of carbon were discovered by Sumio Iijima in deposits on the electrodes of the same carbon arc apparatus that was used to produce fullerenes such as the “buckyball”. Nanotubes of carbon or other materials, consisting ofhollow cylinders that are only a few nanometers in diameter, yet up to millimeters long, are amazing structures that self-assemble under extreme conditions. Their quasi-one-dimensional character and virtual absence of atomic defects give rise to a plethora of unusual phenomena.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">The problem of superconductors has been a central issue in Solid State Physics since 1987. After the discovery of superconductivity (HTSC) in doped perovskites, it was realized that the HTSC appears in an unknown complex electronic phase of c- densed matter. In the early years, all theories of HTSC were focused on the physics of a homogeneous 2D metal with large electron–electron correlations or on a 2D polaron gas. Only after 1990, a novel paradigm started to grow where this 2D metallic phase is described as an inhomogeneous metal. This was the outcome of several experimental evidences of phase separation at low doping. Since 1992, a series of conferences on phase separation were organized to allow scientists to get together to discuss the phase separation and related issues. Following the discovery by the Rome group in 1992 that “the charges move freely mainly in one direction like the water running in the grooves in the corrugated iron foil,” a new scenario to understand superconductivity in the superconductors was open. Because the charges move like rivers, the physics of these materials shifts toward the physics of novel mesoscopic heterostructures and complex electronic solids. Therefore, understanding the striped phases in the perovskites not only provides an opportunity to understand the anomalous metallic state of cuprate superconductors, but also suggests a way to design new materials of technological importance. Indeed, the stripes are becoming a field of general scientific interest.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">For the first half of the 20th Century, low-energy nuclear physics was one of the dominant foci of all of science. Then accelerators prospered and energies rose, leading to an increase of interest in the GeV regime and beyond. The three articles comprising this end-of-century Advances in Nuclear Physics present a fitting and masterful summary of the energy regimes through which nuclear physics has developed and promises to develop in future. One article describes new information about fundamental symmetries found with kV neutrons. Another reviews our progress in understanding nucleon-nucleus scattering up to 1 GeV. The third analyzes dilepton production as a probe for quark-gluon plasmas generated in relativistic heavy-ion collisions.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">The intrinsic or natural fluorescence of proteins is perhaps the most complex area of biochemical fluorescence. Fortunately the fluorescent amino acids, phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan are relatively rare in proteins. Tr- tophan is the dominant intrinsic fluorophore and is present at about one mole % in protein. As a result most proteins contain several tryptophan residues and even more tyrosine residues. The emission of each residue is affected by several excited state processes including spectral relaxation, proton loss for tyrosine, rotational motions and the presence of nearby quenching groups on the protein. Additionally, the tyrosine and tryptophan residues can interact with each other by resonance energy transfer (RET) decreasing the tyrosine emission. In this sense a protein is similar to a three-particle or mul- particle problem in quantum mechanics where the interaction between particles precludes an exact description of the system. In comparison, it has been easier to interpret the fluorescence data from labeled proteins because the fluorophore density and locations could be controlled so the probes did not interact with each other. From the origins of biochemical fluorescence in the 1950s with Prof- sor G. Weber until the mid-1980s, intrinsic protein fluorescence was more qualitative than quantitative. An early report in 1976 by A. Grindvald and I. Z. Steinberg described protein intensity decays to be multi-exponential. Attempts to resolve these decays into the contributions of individual tryp- phan residues were mostly unsuccessful due to the difficulties in resolving closely spaced lifetimes.</dcvalue>

Since the experimental demonstration of Bose Einstein Condensation in dilute atomic gases there has been an explosion of interest in the properties of this novel macroscopic quantum system. The book covers the methods used to produce these new samples of coherent atoms, their manipulation and the study of their properties. Emphasis is given to the anticipated development of new types of sources, which more and more resemble traditional types of lasers. Because of recent new applications and increasing demand for lasers, sensors and associated instrumentation, the chapters also cover current developments in the basic techniques, materials and applications in the field of the generation of coherent atoms.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">“International Energy Forum 1999” was held in Washington D.C. during November 5-6, 1999 in the Hyatt Regency Hotel in Crystal City. Once again the main topic was Nuclear Energy. Various papers presented contained pros and cons of Nuclear Energy for generating electricity. We were aiming to clarify the often discussed subject matter of the virtues of Nuclear Energy with regard to Global Warming as compared to using fossil fuels for the generation of electricity. The latter is also currently the only way to operate our means of transportation like automobiles, planes etc. Therefore emission into the atmosphere of greenhouse gases constitutes the main source of Global Warming, which is absent in the case of Nuclear Energy. These arguments are often put forward to promote the use of Nuclear Energy. However not all is well with the Nuclear Energy. There are the questions of the waste problem so far unsolved, safety of Nuclear Reactors is not guaranteed to the extent that they are inherently safe. If we aim to construct inherently safe reactors, then the economics of a Nuclear Reactor makes it unacceptable.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">The Hans Kleinpoppen Symposium on "Complete Scattering Experiments" th was held in honor of Hans Kleinpoppen’s 70 birthday. It took place in Il Ciocco, Italy. The symposium had two purposes: to present the work that Hans Kleinpoppen has done or initiated during his remarkable scientific career, and to bring people from various fields together who perform complete scattering experiments. Hans Kleinpoppen’s work included electron and photon impact experiments which were accompanied by studies of entangled states - a field of high current interest. Representatives from each of these fields gave excellent lectures on their particular subjects, and many discussions that started during the sessions were continued later in the relaxed atmosphere of the Il Ciocco resort. The breathtaking view of the beautiful landscape will be an unforg- table memory to all who participated in this extraordinary scientific event. The coherent and ideal combination of subject, people and location reflected the coherence of Hans Kleinpoppen’s aims and activities in science and life. We offer our grateful thanks to all contributers who made this volume such a worthy tribute to Hans Kleinpoppen. We also like to thank Rainer Hentges for the painstaking work to prepare this volume in its complete ready to print version. We are also grateful to the Royal Society of London and the Max– Planck–Gesellschaft who generous support of the Hans Kleinpoppen sym- sium made this marvelous meeting and this proceedings possible.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">The origin ofthe International Acoustical Imaging Symposium series can be traced to 1967, when a meeting on acoustical holography was held in C alifornia. In those days, acoustical holography was at the leading edge of research but, as the importance of this subject waned, so the title of the series was changed from Acoustical Holography to Acoustical Imaging in 1978. The early Symposia were held at various venues in the United States. In 1980. the series became international, with the Symposium that year taking place in Cannes in France. The pattern now is to try to met alternately in the USA and in another part of the world so that active researchers everywhere can conveniently attend at a reasonably high frequency. It was a great privilege for us in Bristol in the United Kingdom to be chosen to host the 25th Symposium, which convened on 19 March 2000 and spread over four days. We were blessed not only by good weather, but also by the attendance ofnearly 100 pa rticipants who came from 17 c ountries. A large number of papers were accepted for presentation, either orally or as posters. Whether an oral presentation or a poster, all were considered to have equal merit, and no distinction is made between them in the published proceedings. There were no parallel sessions, so every participant could attend every presentation. The re sultant disciplinary cross fertilisation maintained the t radition of past Symposia.</dcvalue>

Held regularly since 1968, the symposium brings together th leading international researchers in the area of acoustical imaging. The 24 meeting is the third time Santa Barbara hosted this international conference and it is the first time the meeting was held on the campus of the University of California, Santa Barbara. As many regular participants noticed over the years, this symposium has grown significantly in size due to the quality of the presentations as well as the organization itself. A few years ago multiple and poster sessions were introduced in order to accommodate this growth. In addition, the length of the presentations was shortened so more papers could be included in the sessions. During recent meetings there were discussions regarding the possibility of returning to the wonderful years when the symposium was organized in one single session with sufficient time to allow for in-depth presentation as well as discussions of each paper. And the size of the meeting was small enough that people were able to engage in serious technical interactions and all attendees would fit into one photograph. In light of the constraints of the limited budget with respect to the escalating costs it was not considered feasible.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Distance measurements in biological systems by EPR The foundation for understanding function and dynamics of biological systems is knowledge of their structure. Many experimental methodologies are used for determination of structure, each with special utility. Volumes in this series on Biological Magnetic Resonance emphasize the methods that involve magnetic resonance. This volume seeks to provide a critical evaluation of EPR methods for determining the distances between two unpaired electrons. The editors invited the authors to make this a very practical book, with specific numerical examples of how experimental data is worked up to produce a distance estimate, and realistic assessments of uncertainties and of the range of applicability, along with examples of the power of the technique to answer biological problems. The first chapter is an overview, by two of the editors, of EPR methods to determine distances, with a focus on the range of applicability. The next chapter, also by the Batons, reviews what is known about electron spin relaxation times that are needed in estimating distances between spins or in selecting appropriate temperatures for particular experiments. Albert Beth and Eric Hustedt describe the information about spin-spin interaction that one can obtain by simulating CW EPR line shapes of nitroxyl radicals. The information in fluid solution CW EPR spectra of dual-spin labeled proteins is illustrated by Hassane Mchaourab and Eduardo Perozo.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">This text is the published version of many ofthe talks presented at two symposiums held as part of the Southeast Regional Meeting of the American Chemical Society (SERMACS) in Knoxville, TN in October, 1999. The Symposiums, entitled Solution Thermodynamics of Polymers and Computational Polymer Science and Nanotechnology, provided outlets to present and discuss problems of current interest to polymer scientists. It was, thus, decided to publish both proceedings in a single volume. The first part of this collection contains printed versions of six of the ten talks presented at the Symposium on Solution Thermodynamics of Polymers organized by Yuri B. Melnichenko and W. Alexander Van Hook. The two sessions, further described below, stimulated interesting and provocative discussions. Although not every author chose to contribute to the proceedings volume, the papers that are included faithfully represent the scope and quality of the symposium. The remaining two sections are based on the symposium on Computational Polymer Science and Nanotechnology organized by Mark D. Dadmun, Bobby G. Sumpter, and Don W. Noid. A diverse and distinguished group of polymer and materials scientists, biochemists, chemists and physicists met to discuss recent research in the broad field of computational polymer science and nanotechnology. The two-day oral session was also complemented by a number of poster presentations. The first article of this section is on the important subject of polymer blends. M. D.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Oaxaca, Mexico, was the place chosen by a large international group of scientists to meet and discuss on the recent advances on the understanding of the physical prop- ties of low dimensional systems; one of the most active fields of research in condensed matter in the last years. The International Symposium on the Physics of Low Dim- sions took place in January 16-20, 2000. The group of scientists converging into the historical city of Oaxaca, in the state of the same name, had come from Argentina, Chile, Venezuela, several places in Mexico, Canada, U. S. A. , England, France, Italy, Germany, Russia, and Switzerland. The presentations at the workshop provided sta- of-art reviews of many of the most important problems, currently under study. Equally important to all the participants in the workshop was the fact that we had come to honor a friend, Hans Christoph Siegmann, on his sixty-fifth birthday. This Festschrift recognizes the intellectual leadership of Professor Siegmann in the field and as a sincere homage to his qualities as an exceptional friend, college and mentor. Those who have had the privilege to work closely with Hans Christoph have been deeply impressed by his remarkable analytic mind as well as by his out of range kindness and generosity. Hans Christoph has contributed to the understanding of the difficult and very important problem of the magnetic properties of finite systems: surfaces, thin films, heterostructures.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Over the last two years we have witnessed a continuation in the breakthrough shift toward pulse tube cryocoolers for long-life, high-reliability cryocooler applications. One class of pulse tubes that has reached maturity is referred to as "Stirling type" because they are based on the linear Oxford Stirling-cooler type compressor; they generally provide cooling in the 30 to 100 K temperature range and operate at frequencies from 30 to 60 Hz. The other type of pulse tube cooler making great advances is the so-called "Gifford-McMahon type. " Pulse tube coolers of this type use a G-M type compressor and lower frequency operation to achieve temperatures in the 2 to 10 K temperature range. Nearly a third of this proceedings covers these new developments in the pulse tube arena. Complementing the work on low-temperature pulse tubes is substantial continued progress on rare earth regenerator materials and Gifford-McMahon coolers. These technologies continue to make great progress in opening up the 2 - 4 K market. Also in the commercial sector, continued interest is being shown in the development of long-life, low-cost cryocoolers for the emerging high temperature superconductor electronics market, particularly the cellular telephone base-station market. At higher temperature levels, closed-cycle J-T or throttle-cycle refrigerators are taking advantage of mixed refrigerant gases, spearheaded in the former USSR, to achieve low-cost cr- cooler systems in the 65 - 80 K temperature range.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Advances in nanoscale science show that the properties of many materials are dominated by internal structures. In molecular cases, such as window glass and proteins, these internal structures obviously have a network character. However, in many partly disordered electronic materials, almost all attempts at understanding are based on traditional continuum models. This workshop focuses first on the phase diagrams and phase transitions of materials known to be composed of molecular networks. These phase properties characteristically contain remarkable features, such as intermediate phases that lead to reversibility windows in glass transitions as functions of composition. These features arise as a result of self-organization of the internal structures of the intermediate phases. In the protein case, this self-organization is the basis for protein folding. The second focus is on partly disordered electronic materials whose phase properties exhibit the same remarkable features. In fact, the phenomenon of High Temperature Superconductivity, discovered by Bednorz and Mueller in 1986, and now the subject of 75,000 research papers, also arises from such an intermediate phase. More recently discovered electronic phenomena, such as giant magnetoresistance, also are made possible only by the existence of such special phases. This book gives an overview of the methods and results obtained so far by studying the characteristics and properties of nanoscale self-organized networks. It demonstrates the universality of the network approach over a range of disciplines, from protein folding to the newest electronic materials.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Divided into four parts, this book covers recent developments in topics pertaining to gravity theories, including discussions on the presence of scalar fields. Part One is devoted to exact solutions in general relativity, and is mainly concerned with the results of rotating null dust beams and fluids. Also included is a panoramic vision of new research directions in this area, which would require revising certain theorems and their possible extensions within gravity theories, new aspects concerning the Ernst potentials, double Kerr spacetimes, and rotating configurations. In particular, there is a detailed discussion of totally symmetric and totally geodesic spaces, in which a method for generating (2+1)-dimensional solutions from (3+1)-dimensional solutions is given. Part Two deals with alternative theories of gravity, all of which include scalar fields and gauge fields. Here, quantum and cosmological effects, which arise from both gravity theories in four and higher dimensions and from metric-affine theories, are investigated. Part Three is devoted to cosmological and inflationary scenarios. Local effects, such as the influence of scalar fields in protogalactic interactions, numerical studies of the collapse of molecular cores, as well as the inverse inflationary problem and the blue eigenvalue spectrum of it, are considered. Moreover, the role of scalar fields as dark matter and quantum cosmology in the Bergman-Wagoner and Gowdy theories, together with the relation of the conformal symmetry and deflationary gas universe, are likewise presented. The last part of the book includes some mixed topics which are still in the experimental stage. Among them are the foundation of the Maxwell theory, a discussion on electromagnetic Thirring problems, a note on the staticity of black holes with non-minimally coupled scalar fields, and a study of the Lorentz force free charged fluids in general relativity. Thus, this book is the most up-to-date, comprehensive collection of papers on the subject of exact solutions and scalar fields in gravity and is a valuable tool for researchers in the area.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">th The 29 International Conference was held as the first one of the millennium at its Fort Lauderdale venue. These conferences began, with High Energy Physics being the main topic, by introducing gradually cosmology into its programs. These proceedings of the 2000 conference reflect the variety of topics and ideas discussed. Our future conferences will be designed somewhat akin to the early Coral Gables Conferences where we shall seek some convergence of ideas. For this reason various committees have been formed from among the participating physicists. The committees and their memberships are listed in these proceedings. We further decided for the first time to include some graduate student participants in our future meetings for which also a committee has already been established. The topics will demonstrate a more activist structure of the Coral Gables Conferences, for example the duality of the gravitational forces and expansion of the universe will be discussed from this point of view since it conveys a convergence to the ideas of quintessence versus the ordinary theory, which are considered as the cause of the expansion of the universe. We further wish to announce that the future conferences will assume a collective organization where several committees as listed in these proceedings will have their input into the conference. We have now introduced new topics and ideas, which referred especially to the attractive and repulsive nature of the gravitational force. These proceedings of the conference contain a variety of topics and ideas.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Cyclic Polymers (Second Edition) reviews the many recent advances in this rapidly expanding subject since the publication of the first edition in 1986. The preparation, characterisation, properties and applications of a wide range of organic and inorganic cyclic oligomers and polymers are described in detail, together with many examples of catenanes and rotaxanes. The importance of large cyclics in biological chemistry and molecular biology is emphasised by a wide coverage of circular DNA, cyclic peptides and cyclic oligosaccharides and polysaccharides. Experimental techniques and theoretical aspects of cyclic polymers are included, as well as examples of their uses such as ring opening polymerisation reactions to give commercially important materials. This book covers a wide range of topics which should be of interest to many scientific research workers (for example, in polymer science, chemistry and molecular biology), as well as providing a reference text for undergraduate and graduate students.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">This book is written for theoretical and mathematical physicists and mat- maticians interested in recent developments in complex general relativity and their application to classical and quantum gravity. Calculations are presented by paying attention to those details normally omitted in research papers, for pedagogical r- sons. Familiarity with fibre-bundle theory is certainly helpful, but in many cases I only rely on two-spinor calculus and conformally invariant concepts in gravitational physics. The key concepts the book is devoted to are complex manifolds, spinor techniques, conformal gravity, ?-planes, ?-surfaces, Penrose transform, complex 3 1 – – space-time models with non-vanishing torsion, spin- fields and spin- potentials. 2 2 Problems have been inserted at the end, to help the reader to check his und- standing of these topics. Thus, I can find at least four reasons for writing yet another book on spinor and twistor methods in general relativity: (i) to write a textbook useful to - ginning graduate students and research workers, where two-component spinor c- culus is the unifying mathematical language.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Solid-State Imaging with Charge-Coupled Devices covers the complete imaging chain: from the CCD's fundamentals to the applications. The book is divided into four main parts: the first deals with the basics of the charge-coupled devices in general. The second explains the imaging concepts in close relation to the classical television application. Part three goes into detail on new developments in the solid-state imaging world (light sensitivity, noise, device architectures), and part four rounds off the discussion with a variety of applications and the imager technology. The book is a reference work intended for all who deal with one or more aspects of solid- state imaging: the educational, scientific and industrial world. Graduates, undergraduates, engineers and technicians interested in the physics of solid-state imagers will find the answers to their imaging questions. Since each chapter concludes with a short section `Worth Memorizing', reading this short summary allows readers to continue their reading without missing the main message from the previous section.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">There are many excellent books on quantum theory from which one can learn to compute energy levels, transition rates, cross sections, etc. The theoretical rules given in these books are routinely used by physicists to compute observable quantities. Their predictions can then be compared with experimental data. There is no fundamental disagreement among physicists on how to use the theory for these practical purposes. However, there are profound differences in their opinions on the ontological meaning of quantum theory. The purpose of this book is to clarify the conceptual meaning of quantum theory, and to explain some of the mathematical methods which it utilizes. This text is not concerned with specialized topics such as atomic structure, or strong or weak interactions, but with the very foundations of the theory. This is not, however, a book on the philosophy of science. The approach is pragmatic and strictly instrumentalist. This attitude will undoubtedly antagonize some readers, but it has its own logic: quantum phenomena do not occur in a Hilbert space, they occur in a laboratory.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Quantum and chaos, key concepts in contemporary science, are incompatible by nature. This volume presents an investigation into quantum transport in mesoscopic or nanoscale systems which are classically chaotic and shows the success and failure of quantal, semiclassical, and random matrix theories in dealing with questions emerging from the mesoscopic cosmos. These traditional theories are critically analysed, and this leads to a new direction. To reconcile quantum with chaos and to restore genuine temporal chaos in quantum systems, a time-discrete variant of quantum dynamics is proposed. Audience:This book will be of interest to graduate students and researchers in physics, chemistry and mathematics, whose work involves fundamental questions of quantum mechanics in chaotic systems.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">(revised) This is a textbook on classical mechanics at the intermediate level, but its main purpose is to serve as an introduction to a new mathematical language for physics called geometric algebra. Mechanics is most commonly formulated today in terms of the vector algebra developed by the American physicist J. Willard Gibbs, but for some applications of mechanics the algebra of complex numbers is more efficient than vector algebra, while in other applications matrix algebra works better. Geometric algebra integrates all these algebraic systems into a coherent mathematical language which not only retains the advantages of each special algebra but possesses powerful new capabilities. This book covers the fairly standard material for a course on the mechanics of particles and rigid bodies. However, it will be seen that geometric algebra brings new insights into the treatment of nearly every topic and produces simplifications that move the subject quickly to advanced levels. That has made it possible in this book to carry the treatment of two major topics in mechanics well beyond the level of other textbooks. A few words are in order about the unique treatment of these two topics, namely, rotational dynamics and celestial mechanics.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">A course in angular momentum techniques is essential for quantitative study of problems in atomic physics, molecular physics, nuclear physics and solid state physics. This book has grown out of such a course given to the students of the M. Sc. and M. Phil. degree courses at the University of Madras. An elementary knowledge of quantum mechanics is an essential pre-requisite to undertake this course but no knowledge of group theory is assumed on the part of the readers. Although the subject matter has group-theoretic origin, special efforts have been made to avoid the gro- theoretical language but place emphasis on the algebraic formalism dev- oped by Racah (1942a, 1942b, 1943, 1951). How far I am successful in this project is left to the discerning reader to judge. After the publication of the two classic books, one by Rose and the other by Edmonds on this subject in the year 1957, the application of angular momentum techniques to solve physical problems has become so common that it is found desirable to organize a separate course on this subject to the students of physics. It is to cater to the needs of such students and research workers that this book is written. A large number of questions and problems given at the end of each chapter will enable the reader to have a clearer understanding of the subject.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">This book summarizes the proceedings of the invited talks presented at the “International Symposium on Massive TDM and WDM Optical Soliton Tra- mission Systems” held in Kyoto during November 9–12, 1999. The symposium is the third of the series organized by Research Group for Optical Soliton C- munications (ROSC) chaired by Akira Hasegawa. The research group, ROSC, was established in Japan in April 1995 with a support of the Japanese Ministry of Post and Telecommunications to promote collaboration and information - change among communication service companies, communication industries and academic circles in the theory and application of optical solitons. The symposium attracted enthusiastic response from worldwide researchers in the field of soliton based communications and intensive discussions were made. In the symposium held in 1997, new concept of soliton transmission based on dispersion management of optical fibers were presented. This new soliton is now called the dispersion managed soliton. The present symposium mainly focuses the theoretical and experimental developments of dispersion managed solitons. It is remarkable that the concept of the dispersion managed soliton, which was just born two years ago when the naming was not even given yet, has become the center of soliton research in two years. The dispersion managed soliton has an enhanced power in maintaining reasonable signal to noise ratio, yet has reduced Gordon-Haus timing jitter by reduced averagedispersion. The dispersion managed soliton also has demonstrated its power in soliton based WDM transmissions.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">The effect of reduced dimensionality, inherent at the crystallographic level, on the electronic properties of low dimensional materials can be dramatic, leading to structural and electronic instabilities—including supercond- tivity at high temperatures, charge density waves, and localisation—which continue to attract widespread interest. The layered transition metal dichalcogenides have engaged attention for many years, partly arising from the charge density wave effects which some show and the controlled way in which their properties can be modified by intercalation, while the development of epitaxial growth techniques has opened up promising areas based on dichalcogenide heterostructures and quantum wells. The discovery of high-temperature superconducting oxides, and the realisation that polymeric materials too can be exploited in a controlled way for various opto-electronic applications, have further sti- lated interest in the effects of structural dimensionality. It seems timely therefore to draw together some strands of recent research involving a range of disparate materials which share some common char- teristics of low dimensionality. This resulting volume is aimed at researchers with specialist interests in the particular materials discussed but who may also wish to examine the related phenomena observed in different systems, and at a more general solid state audience with broad interests in electronic properties and low dimensional phenomena. Space limitations have required us to be selective as regards particular materials, though we have managed to include those as dissimilar as polymeric semiconductors, superconducting oxides, bronzes and layered chalcogenides.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Quantum well devices have been the objects of intensive research during the last two decades. Some of the devices have matured into commercially useful products and form part of modern electronic circuits. Some others require further dev- opment, but have the promise of being useful commercially in the near future. Study of the devices is, therefore, gradually becoming compulsory for electronics specialists. The functioning of the devices, however, involve aspects of physics which are not dealt with in the available text books on the physics of semicond- tor devices. There is, therefore, a need for a book to cover all these aspects at an introductory level. The present book has been written with the aim of meeting this need. In fact, the book grew out of introductory lectures given by the author to graduate students and researchers interested in this rapidly developing area of electron devices. The book covers the subjects of heterostructure growth techniques, band-offset theory and experiments, electron states, electron-photon interaction and related phenomena, electron transport and the operation of electronic, opto-electronic and photonic quantum well devices. The theory as well as the practical aspects of the devices are discussed at length. The aim of the book is to provide a comprehensive treatment of the physics underlying the various devices. A reader after going through the book should find himself equipped to deal with all kinds of quantum well devices.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">The problem of irreversibility is ubiquitous in physics and chemistry. The present book attempts to present a unified theoretical and conceptual framework for the description of various irreversible phenomena in quantum mechanics. In a sense, this book supplements conventional textbooks on quantum mechanics by including the theory of irreversibilities. However, the content and style of this book are more appropriate for a monograph than a textbook. We have tried to arrange the material so that, as far as possible, the reader need not continually refer elsewhere. The references to the literature make no pretense of completeness. The book is by no means a survey of present theoretical work. We have tried to highlight the basic principles and their results, while the attention has been mainly paid to the problems in which the author himself has been involved. The book as a whole is designed for the reader with knowledge of theoretical physics (especially quantum mechanics) at university level. This book is based on the courses of lectures given at the Chemistry Department of Tel-Aviv University.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">The earliest experimental data on an oxygen-free glass have been published by Schulz-Sellack in 1870 [1]. Later on, in 1902, Wood [2], as well as Meier in 1910 [3], carried out the first researches on the optical properties of vitreous selenium. The interest in the glasses that exhibit transparency in the infrared region of the optical spectrum rose at the beginning of the twentieth century. Firstly were investigated the heavy metal oxides and the transparency limit was extended from (the case of the classical oxide glasses) up to wavelength. In order to extend this limit above the scientists tried the chemical compositions based on the elements of the sixth group of the Periodic Table, the chalcogens: sulphur, selenium and tellurium. The systematic research in the field of glasses based on chalcogens, called chalcogenide glasses, started at the middle of our century. In 1950 Frerichs [4] investigated the glass and published the paper: “New optical glasses transparent in infrared up to 12 . Several years later he started the study of the selenium glass and prepared several binary glasses with sulphur [5]. Glaze and co-workers [6] developed in 1957 the first method for the preparation of the glass at the industrial scale, while Winter-Klein [7] published reports on numerous chalcogenides prepared in the vitreous state.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Our brutal century of atom bombs and spaceships can also be called the century ofpolymers. In any case, the broad spreading ofsynthetic polymer materials is one of thesigns of our time. A look at the various aspects of our life is enough to convince us that polymeric materials (textiles, pl- tics, rubbers) are as widely spread and important in our life as are other materials (metals and non-metals) derived from small molecules. Polymers have entered the life of the twentieth century as irreplaceable construction materials. Polymers differ from other substances by the size of their molecules which, appropriately enough, are referred to as macromolecules, since they consist of thousands or tens of thousands of atoms (molecular weight up to -4 6 10 ormore) andhave a macroscopic rectilinear length (upto 10 cm). The atoms ofa macromolecule are firmly held together by valence bonds, fo- ing a single entity. In polymeric substances, the weaker van der Waals forces have an effect on the components of the macromolecules which form the system. The structure of polymeric systems is more complicated than that oflow-molecular solids or liquids, but there are some common features: the atoms within a given macromolecule are ordered, but the centres ofmass of the individual macromolecules and parts of them are distributed randomly. Remarkably, the mechanical response of polymeric systems combines the elasticity of a solid with the fluidity of a liquid.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">In the first century after its discovery, the electron has come to be a fundamental element in the analysis of physical aspects of nature. This book is devoted to the construction of a deductive theory of the electron, starting from first principles and using a simple mathematical tool, geometric analysis. Its purpose is to present a comprehensive theory of the electron to the point where a connection can be made with the main approaches to the study of the electron in physics. The introduction describes the methodology. Chapter 2 presents the concept of space-time-action relativity theory and in chapter 3 the mathematical structures describing action are analyzed. Chapters 4, 5, and 6 deal with the theory of the electron in a series of aspects where the geometrical analysis is more relevant. Finally in chapter 7 the form of geometrical analysis used in the book is presented to elucidate the broad range of topics which are covered and the range of mathematical structures which are implicitly or explicitly included. The book is directed to two different audiences of graduate students and research scientists: primarily to theoretical physicists in the field of electron physics as well as those in the more general field of quantum mechanics, elementary particle physics, and general relativity; secondly, to mathematicians in the field of geometric analysis.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Classical spin is described in terms of velocities and acceleration so that knowledge of advanced mathematics is not required. Written in the three-dimensional notation of vector calculus, it can be followed by undergraduate physics students, although some notions of Lagrangian dynamics and group theory are required. It is intended as a general course at a postgraduate level for all-purpose physicists. This book presents a unified approach to classical and quantum mechanics of spinning particles, with symmetry principles as the starting point. A classical concept of an elementary particle is presented. The variational statements to deal with spinning particles are revisited. It is shown that, by explicitly constructing different models, symmetry principles are sufficient for the description of either classical or quantum-mechanical elementary particles. Several spin effects are analyzed.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Evidence that Einstein's addition is regulated by the Thomas precession has come to light, turning the notorious Thomas precession, previously considered the ugly duckling of special relativity theory, into the beautiful swan of gyrogroup and gyrovector space theory, where it has been extended by abstraction into an automorphism generator, called the Thomas gyration. The Thomas gyration, in turn, allows the introduction of vectors into hyperbolic geometry, where they are called gyrovectors, in such a way that Einstein's velocity additions turns out to be a gyrovector addition. Einstein's addition thus becomes a gyrocommutative, gyroassociative gyrogroup operation in the same way that ordinary vector addition is a commutative, associative group operation. Some gyrogroups of gyrovectors admit scalar multiplication, giving rise to gyrovector spaces in the same way that some groups of vectors that admit scalar multiplication give rise to vector spaces. Furthermore, gyrovector spaces form the setting for hyperbolic geometry in the same way that vector spaces form the setting for Euclidean geometry. In particular, the gyrovector space with gyrovector addition given by Einstein's (Möbius') addition forms the setting for the Beltrami (Poincaré) ball model of hyperbolic geometry. The gyrogroup-theoretic techniques developed in this book for use in relativity physics and in hyperbolic geometry allow one to solve old and new important problems in relativity physics. A case in point is Einstein's 1905 view of the Lorentz length contraction, which was contradicted in 1959 by Penrose, Terrell and others. The application of gyrogroup-theoretic techniques clearly tilt the balance in favor of Einstein.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">The title of this book is no surprise for people working in the field of Analytical Mechanics. However, the geometric concepts of Lagrange space and Hamilton space are completely new. The geometry of Lagrange spaces, introduced and studied in [76],[96], was ext- sively examined in the last two decades by geometers and physicists from Canada, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Japan, Romania, Russia and U.S.A. Many international conferences were devoted to debate this subject, proceedings and monographs were published [10], [18], [112], [113],... A large area of applicability of this geometry is suggested by the connections to Biology, Mechanics, and Physics and also by its general setting as a generalization of Finsler and Riemannian geometries. The concept of Hamilton space, introduced in [105], [101] was intensively studied in [63], [66], [97],... and it has been successful, as a geometric theory of the Ham- tonian function the fundamental entity in Mechanics and Physics. The classical Legendre’s duality makes possible a natural connection between Lagrange and - miltonspaces. It reveals new concepts and geometrical objects of Hamilton spaces that are dual to those which are similar in Lagrange spaces. Following this duality Cartan spaces introduced and studied in [98], [99],..., are, roughly speaking, the Legendre duals of certain Finsler spaces [98], [66], [67]. The above arguments make this monograph a continuation of [106], [113], emphasizing the Hamilton geometry.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Today many important directions of research are being pursued more or less independently of each other. These are, for instance, strings and mem branes, induced gravity, embedding of spacetime into a higher dimensional space, the brane world scenario, the quantum theory in curved spaces, Fock Schwinger proper time formalism, parametrized relativistic quantum the ory, quantum gravity, wormholes and the problem of “time machines”, spin and supersymmetry, geometric calculus based on Clifford algebra, various interpretations of quantum mechanics including the Everett interpretation, and the recent important approach known as “decoherence”. A big problem, as I see it, is that various people thoroughly investigate their narrow field without being aware of certain very close relations to other fields of research. What we need now is not only to see the trees but also the forest. In the present book I intend to do just that: to carry out a first approximation to a synthesis of the related fundamental theories of physics. I sincerely hope that such a book will be useful to physicists. From a certain viewpoint the book could be considered as a course in the oretical physics in which the foundations of all those relevant fundamental theories and concepts are attempted to be thoroughly reviewed. Unsolved problems and paradoxes are pointed out. I show that most of those ap proaches have a common basis in the theory of unconstrained membranes. The very interesting and important concept of membrane space, the tensor calculus in and functional transformations in are discussed.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">From the President of the Research Society on Alcoholism On behalf of the Research Society on Alcoholism, I am pleased to introduce this thirteenth volume of Recent Developments in Alcoholism about alcohol and violence. Current concepts are presented in well-organized sections that - cus on epidemiology, neurobiology, psychology, and family issues. It is - coming increasingly clear that age, gender, socioeconomic circumstances, and genetics affect aggressive behavior and vulnerability to alcoholism. This v- ume contains up-to-date discussions of these issues. Indeed, the information presented here will help all alcohol researchers to identify biological and social factors that contribute to the comorbidity of alcoholism and aggression. The editors and associate editors should be congratulated for bringing toge- er such important information. This volume will be a valuable resource for investigators and therapists alike. Ivan Diamond M. D. , Ph. D. President, Research Society on Alcoholism From the President of the American Society of Addiction Medicine The American Society of Addiction Medicine is honored to continue its - sponsorship with the Research Society on Alcoholism of Recent Developmen ts in Alcoholism. The topic of alcohol and violence is a particularly timely one, given the growing number of studies that are examining the relationship between the two. These studies are consistent with the hypothesis that al- hol can increase aggression and contribute to both domestic and criminal violence. Intoxicating blood levels of alcohol have been found to be especially prevalent in those injured in fights and assaults.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Originally distributed with a different title as a very limited edition of twelve in 1975, Historical Archaeology in Wachovia presents a unique record of the 1753 Moravian town of Bethabara, near Winston-Salem, North Carolina. Stanley South, who led the site's excavation in 1966, fully describes such discoveries as fortifications from the French and Indian War and twenty ruins of various shops and dwellings in the town. He also illustrates methods of ruin excavation and stabilization, including the replacement of palisade posts in the original fort ditch as part of the site's development as Historic Bethabara Park. Some of the most interesting of South's finds concern the confluence of two traditions of pottery and stoneware production. One of these is represented by forty pottery wheel-thrown types and forms made by the master German potter Gottfried Aust between 1755 and 1771, excavated from the ruin of his shop and kiln waster dump. Additional work at both Bethabara and Salem recovered the waster dumps of Aust's journeyman potter Rudolph Christ, who had also studied with the Staffordshire potter William Ellis. Christ's wares, which demonstrate both German and English influences, are discussed in detail. Extensively documented and heavily illustrated with over 320 photographs, drawings, and maps, this volume - a classic example of the process of historical archaeology as demonstrated by one of its foremost practitioners in America - is a valuable resource for avocational archaeologists, particularly those living in the Southeast, as well as historical archaeologists, historians, ceramicists, ceramics collectors, students of colonial culture, and museologists.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Research on small groups played an important role in the early formulation of social psychology. By the 1970s, however, the field had lost the interest of most social psychologists. Theory and Research on Small Groups reintegrates that work back into the mainstream of social psychology. The more recent `issues-oriented' approach has not only resulted in many interesting findings-it has also applied basic social psychological theory in new ways and, moreover, led to new theoretical developments that deserve more attention. This volume, which features the work of esteemed researchers from around the world, is a bountiful resource worthy of notice by all social psychologists.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Examination stress and test anxiety are pervasive problems in modern society. As the information age continues to evolve, test scores will become even more important than they are today in evaluating applicants for demanding jobs and candidates for admission into highly competitive educational programs. Because test anxiety gen- ally causes decrements in performance and undermines academic achievement, the development of effective therapeutic interventions for reducing its adverse effects will continue to be an important priority for counselors, psychologists, and educators. Alleviating test anxiety will also serve to counteract the diminished access to edu- tional and occupational opportunities that is frequently experienced by test-anxious individuals. As its title promises, this volume provides a state-of-the-art evaluation of the nature, antecedents, correlates, and consequences of examination stress and test anxiety. Professor Zeidner’s cogent and comprehensive analysis of the affective, cognitive, somatic, and behavioral manifestations of test anxiety are grounded in the extensive knowledge he has gained from his own research on the assessment and treatment of test anxiety. This work has also benefitted from the author’s lo- standing and productive collaboration with leading contributors to test anxiety theory and research, and his active participation in national and international conferences devoted to understanding test anxiety, including those convened by the Society for Test Anxiety Research (STAR).</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">This book presents new and important information about adolescent drug use. The book is intended for human service professionals, teachers, researchers, and students interested in the issue of early adolescent drug use and its causes and pervasiveness in a multiethnic population. Today, the field of adolescent drug use research relies on integrative models that permit competing explanations of drug use. This approach promotes flexibility in testing hypotheses pertinent to adol- cents of very different social and cultural backgrounds or personal characteristics. Longitudinal studies, including the one presented in these pages, have identified many risk and protective factors or processes that are linked to adolescent drug use. We review these throughout this book and present new information from our own research. Our point of departure is to extend and elaborate descriptive research and models of adolescent drug research to cover the unique and diverse experiences of adolescents who are Hispanic, African American, and White non-Hispanic.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">This book arises from a conference held in November 1996 designed to examine how competence can be improved in the different stages ofthe lifespan. To this end, we brought together eminent researchers in different areas of human development—infancy, childhood, and adulthood, including the late adult years. The conference was based on the premise that discussion arising from the interfaces of research and practice would increase our knowledge of and stimulate the further application of effective interventions designed to improve competence. The editors wish to acknowledge the contributions of Concordia University and the Fonds pour la Formation de Chercheurs et l’Aide a la Recherche (FCAR) in providing funding and other assistance toward the conference “Improving Competence Across the Lifespan” and toward the publication of this book. Finally, we wish to express our gratitude to the numerous students associated with our Centre for their help and to Gail Pitts and Lesley Husband of the Centre for Research in Human Development for their assistance. We are especially grateful to Donna Craven, Centre for Research in Human Development, for her heroic work on both the conference and the present volume. We could not have met our goals without you.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">East meets West in this fascinating exploration of conceptions of personal identity in Indian philosophy and modern Euro-American psychology. Author Anand Paranjpe considers these two distinct traditions with regard to historical, disciplinary, and cultural `gaps' in the study of the self, and in the context of such theoretical perspectives as univocalism, relativism, and pluralism. The text includes a comparison of ideas on self as represented by two eminent thinkers-Erik H. Erikson for the Western view, and Advaita Vedanta for the Indian.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">In this fascinating volume, the Middle Paleolithic archaeology of the Middle East is brought to the current debate on the origins of modern humans. These collected papers gather the most up-to-date archaeological discoveries of Western Asia - a region that is often overshadowed by African or European findings - but the only region in the world where both Neandertal and early modern human fossils have been found. The collection includes reports on such well known cave sites as Kebara, Hayonim, and Qafzeh, among others. The information and interpretations available here are a must for any serious researcher or student of anthropology or human evolution.</dcvalue>

The text, based on the author's four decades of personal study and data collection, thoroughly explores the physiological, biochemical, and genetic bases of temperament - incorporating age-specific methods of assessment developed through child- and adult-oriented approaches. The 147 illustrations comprise tables of the most popular temperament inventories for both children and adults, and unique data tables illustrating the psychometric features of temperament inventories based on self-rating and rating by others.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Despite the fact that, for most of us, time is a central focus of our lives, the examination of what we do with our time and why has received limited attention as a method for understanding human behavior in the social sciences. Humans' view and use of time shows tremendous variation, including across cultures and with age, lifestyle, and gender. For many of us, a sense of time is ever-present. We speak of time as a commodity, a resource, an ally, an enemy, and a gift. It maybe on our side, on our hands, with us, or against us. We perceive it to change speeds (dragging vs. flying vs. standing still) and lest it get away on us, we attempt to harness and control it with clocks, schedules, and deadlines. We describe our use of time in a myriad ofways: we spend it, save it, waste it, kill it, give it, take it, and grab it. The impetus for this book grew from a three-day research symposium where established time use researchers from a variety of disciplines from Canada, the United States, Finland, Australia, and New Zealand gathered together to merge their knowledge and resources to collaborate in exam- ing the relationship between human time utilization and health and we- being. We gratefully acknowledge the financial support for the sym- sium received from the Government of Canada's Program for Inter- tional Research Linkages and M. Powell Lawton, without whose support and encouragement this book would likely not exist.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Globally, action to prevent HIV spread is inadequate. Over 16,000 new infections occur every day. Yet we are not helpless in the face of disaster, as shown by the rich prevention experience analyzed in this valuable new compendium. “Best pr- tice” exists—a set of tried and tested ways of slowing the spread of HIV, of persuading and enabling people to protect themselves and others from the virus. Individually, features of best practice can be found almost everywhere. The tragedy, on a world scale, is that prevention is spotty, not comprehensive; the measures are not being applied on anywhere near the scale needed, or with the right focus or synergy. The national response may concentrate solely on sex workers, for example. Elsewhere, efforts may go into school education for the young, but ignore the risks and vulnerability of men who have sex with men. Action may be patchy geographically. AIDS prevention may not benefit from adequate commitment from all parts and sectors of society, compromising the sustainability of the response. In some countries matters are still worse—there is still hardly any action at all against AIDS and scarcely any effort to make HIV visible. It is no wonder that the epidemic is still emerging and in some places is altogether out of control.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">“AIDS is kind of like life, just speeded up. ” JavonP. ,heroinaddictwithAIDS, Bronx,NewYork, 1988 “Now I’m not so much scared of dying as scared of living. ” Mike D. , heroin addict with AIDS, New Haven, Connecticut, 1998 Within little more than a decade, AIDS has been tranformed from an untreatable, rapidly fatal illness, into a manageable, chronic disease. Most of this tranformation has occurred in the past five years, accelerated by the advent of protease inhibitors and the proven benefits of combination antiretroviral therapy and prophylaxis against opportunistic infections. For people living with HIV/AIDS, these developments have offered unprecedented hope, and also new challenges. As reflected in the quotes above, some of the anxieties and anticipation of premature dying have been replaced by the uncertainties involved in living with a long-term, unpredictable illness. The role of caregivers for people with HIV/AIDS has also changed radically over this time. Earlier in the epidemic, we learned to accompany patients through illness, to bear witness, to advocate, to address issues of death, dying, and - reavement. The arrival of more effective therapy has brought with it new capabi- ties, but also new complexities, raising difficult problems concerning access to care, adherence, and toxicity.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Social Networks, Drug Injectors' Lives, and HIV/AIDS recognizes HIV as a socially structured disease - its transmission usually requires intimate contact between individuals - and shows how social networks shape high-risk behaviors and the spread of HIV. The authors recount the groundbreaking use of social network methods, ethnographic direct-observation techniques, and in-depth interviews in their study of a drug-using community in Brooklyn, New York. They provide a detailed documentary of the lives of community members. They describe drug-use, the affects of poverty and homelessness, the acquisition of money and drugs, and social relationships within the group. Social Networks, Drug Injectors' Lives, and HIV/AIDS shows that social networks and contexts are of crucial importance in understanding and fighting the AIDS epidemic. These findings should revitalize prevention efforts and reshape social policy.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">The multidisciplinary research program at Akrotiri Aetokremnos is important, in my op- ion, for three reasons: two empirical and one conceptual. Quite apart from the archaeology, work at the site is a major contribution to island biogeography, in that the Phanourios sample—certainly the best from Cyprus and probably the best anywhere in the world—has already provided, and will continue to provide, important ecological and behavioral data on these intriguing creatures. Dwarfed island faunas are important to our understanding of the complex factors that shape natural selection in ecologically closed environments over the evolutionary long term. At Aetokremnos, we seem to have the “end” of a long sequence of hippo evolution on the island. With comparative studies of other Cypriot hippo faunas, we should be able to pin down the interval of initial colonization by what were, pres- ably, normal-sized hippos, and—if the other sites can be dated—document the dwarfing process in considerable detail. Aetokremnos would still be a significant paleontological - cality, even in the absence of evidence of a human presence there. While reading the text of the monograph, a number of questions strictly related to the paleontology occurred to me. One was how to model the colonization process. There seems to be little question that the large mammals colonized the island by swimming to it (because, I gather, Cyprus has not been connected to the mainland for roughly 5–6 m- lion years).</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">It is difficult for today's students of archaeology to imagine an era when chronometric dating methods were unavailable. However, even a casual perusal of the large body of literature that arose during the first half of the twentieth century reveals a battery of clever methods used to determine the relative ages of archaeological phenomena, often with considerable precision. Stratigraphic excavation is perhaps the best known of the various relative-dating methods used by prehistorians. Although there are several techniques of using artifacts from superposed strata to measure time, these are rarely if ever differentiated. Rather, common practice is to categorize them under the heading `stratigraphic excavation'. This text distinguishes among the several techniques and argues that stratigraphic excavation tends to result in discontinuous measures of time - a point little appreciated by modern archaeologists. Although not as well known as stratigraphic excavation, two other methods of relative dating have figured important in Americanist archaeology: seriation and the use of index fossils. The latter (like stratigraphic excavation) measures time discontinuously, while the former - in various guises - measures time continuously. Perhaps no other method used in archaeology is as misunderstood as seriation, and the authors provide detailed descriptions and examples of each of its three different techniques. Each method and technique of relative dating is placed in historical perspective, with particular focus on developments in North America, an approach that allows a more complete understanding of the methods described, both in terms of analytical technique and disciplinary history. This text will appeal to all archaeologists, from graduate students to seasoned professionals, who want to learn more about the backbone of archaeological dating.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">When we say that a person deserves a positive or negative outcome, we are making a judgment that is influenced by a number ofvariables. We would certainly take into account whether the person was resp- siblefortheoutcomeorwhethertheoutcomecouldbeattributedtoother sources. We would also consider whether the actions that led to the positive or negative outcome were actions that we would value or - tionsthatwouldmeetwithourdisapproval.Wemightalsobeinfluenced by the person’s own positive or negative characteristics, by ourkno- edgeofwhatkinds ofgroups orsocialcategoriesthepersonbelongedto, and by whether we like or dislike the person. Information about these differentvariableshastobe consideredandintegratedin someway, and our judgment of deservingness follows that psychological process, a process that involves the cognitive-affective system. Values, Achievements, and Justice is about deservingness and about the variables that affect the judgments we make. I use the term “dese- ingness” although I could equally have referred to “deservedness” or “desert.” The terms are all virtually equivalent in meaning, although dictionaries may separate them by using fine distinctions. I assume that the sorts of variables I have just described will affect ourjudgments of deservingness, and I further assume that a judgment of deservingness is most likely to occur when these variables fit together in a consistent, harmonious, and balanced way.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">A glance at the title of this book might well beg the question “What in heaven’s name does archaeology have to do with manners? We cannot dig up manners or mannerly behavior—or can we?” One might also ask “Why is mannerly behavior important?” and “What can archaeology contribute to our understanding of the role of manners in the devel- ment of social relations and cultural identity in early America?” English colonists in America and elsewhere sought to replicate English notions of gentility and social structure, but of necessity div- ged from the English model. The first generation of elites in colonial America did not spring from the landed gentry of old England. Rather, they were self-made, newly rich, and newly possessed of land and other trappings of England’s genteel classes. The result was a new model of gentry culture that overcame the contradiction between a value system in which gentility was conferred by birth, and the new values of bo- geois materialism and commercialism among the emerging colonial elites. Manners played a critical role in the struggle for the cultural legitimacy of gentility; mannerly behavior—along with exhibition of refined taste in architecture, fashionable clothing, elegant furnishings, and literature—provided the means through which the new-sprung colonial elites defined themselves and validated their claims on power and prestige to accompany their newfound wealth.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">For many years, one of my favorite classroom devices in historical archaeology was to ask the students to imagine that they had to make the choice between saving—from some unnamed calamity—all master’s theses or all doctoral disser tations in anthropology, but not both. Like good students, they usually looked to their Ph.D. holding professor and chose the dissertations. Much to their surprise, Iwouldrespondthatthetheseswould win withouteventakingtime to ponderthe issue. The issue is clearly one of often naïve and rarely eloquent theses full of good primary data versus sometimes more sophisticated and better written works full of irrelevant theory and meaningless statistics. Perhaps this is an overstate ment of the situation, but it is not too far offthe mark. The University Microfilms International efforts to make the titles of disser tations in North America and the English speaking portions of Europe available through Dissertation Abstracts is commendable. With only one minor exception, dissertations in historical and underwater archaeology in the United States are to be found listed in Dissertation Abstracts and thus are available for purchase.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Historical archaeology, one of the fastest growing of archaeology’s sub fields in North America, has developed more slowly in Central and p- ticularly South America. Happily, this circumstance is ending as a gr- ing number of recent projects are successfully integrating textual and material culture data in studies of the events and processes of the last 500 years. This interval and this region–often called Ibero-America–have been studied for a century or more by historians with traditional perspectives and emphases focusing on colonial elites and large-scale politico-economic events. Such inclinations fit well into world-system and other core-peri- ery models that have had a major impact on historical thought since the 1970s. Over the past 20 years or so, however, world-system models have come under fire from historians, anthropologists, and others, in part because the emphasis on global trends and the growth of capitalism - nies the importance of understanding variability in local histories and circumstances. Historians have increasingly turned their attention to lo cal, rural, and domestic contexts, thereby illuminating the great diversity of responses to colonial domination that were played out in the vast arena of the Americas. It is not coincidental that this is the intellectual climate in which historical archaeology is establishing itself in Central and South America.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Archaeology can either bolster memory and tradition, or contradict the status quo and provide an alternative view of the past. An archaeology of Harpers Ferry's wartime and Victorian eras confronts time-honored historical interpretations of the past (created and perpetuated by such interest groups as historians and the National Park Service) and in so doing allows us to be more inclusive of the town's forgotten histories and provides alternative voices to a past.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">The inter-comparison of specific skills as represented by performance on neu- psychological tests is at the heart of the neuropsychological assessment process. However, there is a tendency to regard the interpretation of single tests as a process that is independent of performance on other tests, with integration of test information representing a summary of these individual test performances. As neuropsychology has become increasingly sophisticated, it has been recognized that many factors influence the performance on any given test. The meaning of the same score may vary considerably from one person to another, depending on his or her performance on other neuropsychological tests. Thus, a low score on the Halstead Category Test may indeed reflect frontal lobe damage, but only if we first rule out the influence of visual-spatial problems, emotionality, attentional issues, motivation, fatigue, and comprehension of the instructions. Simplistic interpre- tions that assume a common interpretation based on a specific score will inva- ably lead to errors in interpretation and conclusions. The purpose of this book is to provide each test that is described with a compendium of the possible interpretations that can be used with a variety of common tests that are often included in a neuropsychological test battery. The first chapter discusses some of the pitfalls and cautions when comparing the tests, while the second chapter examines administrative and scoring issues that may be unclear or unavailable for a given test.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">The Social and Spatial Ecology of Work is an important contribution to the P- num Studies in Work and Industry. It is a theoretically informed case study, unique in that it takes full measure of the importance of physical space and the built environment for the quality of people’s daily working lives and the attainment of organizational goals. Rita Gorawara-Bhat provides us with a theoretical framework for understanding how important space and envir- ment are for experiential aspects of work as they are contextualized in social relations, linked to status and role, and embedded in organizational culture and bureaucratic structure. Her framework is a creatively synthetic one that draws notably from traditions in social psychology, symbolic interactionism, dramaturgical sociology, and social ecology. Sociologists will find themselves in comfortable surroundings; this is a case study of a major social science research center affiliated with a prominent midwestern university. Studies carried out by psychologists and social psychologists in the - cades of the 1960s and 1970s held great promise for introducing a language and methodology for inquiry about the importance of the physical envir- ment for social life. However, the overall impact of this research turned out to be short lived, perhaps owing to overly deterministic assumptions about space and spatial constraints.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">The production of this book represents a culmination for me of some 25 years of interest in the field of personality and substance use and abuse. In choosing the field of substanceuse and abuse for the focus of our research, all of the investi- tors collaborating in this research have been sustained by the awareness that the work we are doing has an important purpose. Substance abuse continues to have enormous impacts on individuals and families,and prevention and treatment - proaches developed to date have not always been as successful as we would hope to see. New advances in our fundamental understanding of the causal mec- nisms involved in the development ofaddiction may be necessary to advance our success in developing new forms of prevention and treatment for alcohol and drug abuse. The work in this book builds on the work of numerous previous investi- tors who have been drawn to investigate this topic. As you will notice in the extensive reference list, there have been hundreds of articles published on this topic. Although each of these references has added a small piece to our und- standing of the relationship between personality and alcohol abuse, the majority of these studies have been done on clinical samples and often involved no control groups or poorly matched control groups. Several important previous longitu- nal investigations have been conducted,but these investigations have usually not included general population samples or comprehensivepersonality test batteries.</dcvalue>

As I go about my daily life, I read and hear about the sometimes scary things that are happening to other people. As the saying goes, bad news sells newspapers. But I u- ally can take some solace in reasoning that this bad stuff assuredly will not occur in my life. After reading this book, however, one message has gotten through–I cannot d- miss "those" older people described in the various chapters as being dissimilar to me. After all, "old person" is a term that can be applied to me in a few more years. On this point, I once heard the following rhetorical question applied to the prejudice actions of the TV character Archie Bunker: "What would he say about "those" Puerto Ricans, if, on his next birthday, he knew that he would become a Puerto Rican?" As to aging, we best pay close attention because we soon will be "those" elders. This is why the alarming facts of this book-that our elders often are experiencing elevatedlevelsofphysicalillnessesanddepression–grabbedmebytheproverbialthroat.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Is history more than (in Boswell's words) a `chronological series of remarkable events'? Does it have a pattern? Is it fraught with `meaning'? Can we discern its trends? What determines its course? In short, can a substantial and coherent philosophy of history be devised that offers answers to these questions? These issues, which have intrigued -and bedeviled - historians for centuries, are explored in this thoughtful book.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">The background for the international research conference “Health Hazards and Challenges in the New Working Life” was the emerging questions concerning the health and social effects of the rapid changes in the labour market leading to increasing long-term unemployment, temporary employment and irregular employment contracts. We knew that other countries have had this development at the labour market for a much longer time than Sweden has and it seemed a good idea to invite interested researchers and practitioners to an international seminar to share the relevant research findings and discuss future research needs. Thus, the first international, interdisciplinary research conference on “Health Hazards and Challenges in the New Working Life” was arranged in Stockholm during the last year of the 2nd millennium but was directed towards the foreseen development during the next millennium. We were very pleased that more than 200 participants came to a cold and dark country just after New Year’s Eve, and that it was a truly multidisciplinary setting. It became very obvious that it is necessary for the occupational health and safety research community to reach out to the public health research community as well as to the social and political sciences in order to understand the determinants and to perform comprehensive analyses at several levels in this new labour market situation.</dcvalue>

Health Care Development Stratrategies in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia acquaints readers with the current health policy environment, organization and delivery of health services in the Kingdom. Present financing means, both government and private, and future financing methods such as a proposed national health insurance program and user-changes are presented and reviewed. Important strategic issues are discussed in regard to cost effectiveness, quality of services, utilization management, certificate of need, and the necessity for integration and cooperation among health sector agencies. Providing information on the Saudi health system and any planned or proposed reformation in the health sector, is beneficial to healthcare directors, planners and strategists and will be of interest to experts and international investors in health system reorganization.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Tina Thurston’s Landscapes of Power; Landscapes of Conflict is a thi- generation processual analysis of sociopolitical evolution during the Iron Age in southern Scandinavia. Several red flags seem to be raised at once. Are not archaeologists now postprocessual, using new interpretive approaches to - derstand human history? Is not evolution a discredited concept in which - cieties are arbitrarily arranged along a unilinear scheme? Should not modern approaches be profoundly historical and agent-centered? In any event, were not Scandinavians the ultimate barbarian Vikings parasitizing the complex civilized world of southern and central Europe? Tina Thurston’s book focuses our attention on the significant innovations of anthropological archaeology at the end of the twentieth century. A brief overview of processual archaeology can set the context for - preciating Landscapes ofPower; Landscapes of Conflict. During the 1960s the emergent processual archaeology (a. k. a. the New Archaeology) cryst- lized an evolutionary paradigm that framed research with the comparative ethnography of Service and Fried. It was thought that human societies p- gressed through stages of social development and that the goal was to d- cover the evolutionary prime movers (such as irrigation, warfare, trade, and population) that drove social and cultural change. By the 1970s prime movers had fallen from favor and social evolution was conceived as complicated flows of causation involving many variables.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Over the past 15 years, I (MB) have taught a graduate-level course in Psychology of Women to students in two different professional psychology programs. Because my students were at the doctoral level and often had some familiarity with the psychology of women, these courses focused on bringing a feminist analysis of psychology and integrating a feminist analysis into one’s scholarly work and professional activities. Although I used several fine psychology of women textbooks during this time, I found none that was specifically designed for graduate students. Thus, I always augmented the textbook with journal articles on specific aspects of the topic, and these focused articles have typically been well received by the students. The s- dents whom I have encountered in these courses have often expressed a wish for a textbook that is designed for their needs; I think what they are asking for is one that could serve as a foundation for their scholarly analysis of psychology as well as a springboard for thoughtful application of a feminist perspective to the profession of psychology. Therefore, Issues in the Psychology of Women has been designed to serve as a textbook for advanced undergraduate or graduate courses including Psychology of Women or Feminist Analysis of Psychology. This book is the collective work of authors with special expertise in their chapter topic.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">This book should be of interest to scholars, researchers, students, and practitioners alike. Scholars, researchers, and students of personal relationship development will recognize in this book the first serious attempt in over 40 years to do a large-scale, longitudinal study of premarital factors that predict premarital breakup and marital quality; they should also appreciate our attempt to develop a theoretical rationale for predicted paths and to test those paths with the best available statistical tools. Practitioners-while generally not as interested in the intricacies of the statistical results-will find much that is useful to them as they help individuals and couples make decisions about their intimate relationships, their readiness for marriage, and how to increase the probability for marital success. Teachers, family life educators, premarital counselors, and clergy will find helpful our “principles for practice,” particularly as described in Chapter 9, as they teach and counsel couples in any premarital situation. My interest in the development of relationships from premarital to marital probably began when I got married in 1972 and started to notice all of the characteristics my wife and I brought from our respective families and how our “new beginning” as a married couple was in many ways the continuation of our premarital relationship, only more refined and more intense. My professional interest began when I did my doctoral dissertation in 198 1 on premarital predictors of early marital satisfaction (the results of that study are reported in Chapter 8).</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Thisbook is the fruit of a number of years of assimilating another culture and learning about the evolution of its institutions, altogether an incr- iblyrich andrewarding experience. Ihopetopassonto the reader some of that richness in the belief that, even in a “globalizing” context, learning about other nations and cultures is more and more necessary. The reasons andvalues behind this belief are perhaps evident,but I amconvincedthat they bear repeating here. To begin with, the hasty generalizations that often liebehind the cynicism—and ultimately the violence—of ethnocentrism and xe- phobia are still being aired today and still need to be fought, even in “unified and advanced” regions of the world like Europe and the United States. The historical and social sciences disciplines need to be solicited constantly in this combat, even though they themselves are terrains of controversy and contestation. I personally have not lost faith in their “progressive” potential and character. Second, my belief is that only through this process of appeal to these disciplines and their findings can we resist a dangerous contemporary slide into simplisticand sensation- ist pictures of the world—viewpoints often associated with an implicit assumption that social and economic change are linear processes, so- how unfolding according to the same neat “logic” wherever they are at work.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Drawing data from a classic region for Paleolithic research in Europe, this book explores how early modern humans obtained lithic raw materials and analyzes the different utilization patterns for locally available materials compared with those from a greater distance. The author locates these patterns within an ecological context and argues that early modern humans selected specific mobility strategies to accommodate changes in subsistence environments.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Statistics emphasize that one out of every five men is incarcerated. The background experiences of dysfunctional black men are often explored while few studies focus on the motivating triggers for high achieving black men. Successful African American Men: From Childhood to Adulthood is a unique study of the nurturing behavioral settings that high achieving black men used as adolescents and examines whether social capital played a role in helping them negotiate their way out of disadvantage. Equally important, is how these settings accommodated the men's diversity, complexity, and the influence of black culture, and reconciled it to their ability to respond and cope with mainstream America. This volume will be of interest to psychologists, sociologists, anthropologists and others interested in the rich diversity of experience found within communities of color.</dcvalue>

This relatively straightforward assignment turned into a long-term research program for applying maritime archaeology to the conservation of iron-hulled wrecks.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">The family, that most fundamentalof human groups, is currently perceived to be changing in response to social, biological, cultural and technological developments in our postmodernsociety. While the observed changes in families have been considered by some sociologists to be evidence of adaptation and, therefore, normal, the authors of this volume, consider them maladaptive. Viewing society from the point of view of clinical psychiatry, they point to greatly increased numbers of children born to single mothers, soaring rates of divorce, a statistically confirmed increase in mental disorders, increase in reported incest, high rates of depression in younger people and escalation of the amount of reported family violence as evidence that the family, as a social institution, is in crisis and can either move toward renewed vitality or continued deterioration. Perceiving a need to obtain information about family functioning that might lead to the increased stability and well-being of this critically important type of system, Dr. John Schwab and his associates designed and camed out a research program that began with a thorough review of relevant literature beginning with LePlay’s study of 300 families in the 1850’sand including important recent statistical studies. They found that although these studies represent advances in understanding the family system, some serious problems with the research remain, one of which is confounding variables such as family function and mental or substance abuse disorders so that if a family member has a problem, such as drug abuse, the family is classifiedasdysfunctional.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">From the President ofthe Research Society onAlcoholism - On behalf of the Research Society on Alcoholism I welcome the important contri bution that Volume 15 of this excellent series on Recent Developments in Alcoh- ism brings to our field. It is not enough for our scientists to develop effective and efficient methods to identify and treat alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence; the availability of these services is often limited and it is certainly nonexistent for the early problem drinker. In nineteen outstanding chapters, Volume 15 deals with organizational issues concerning access to and delivery of substance abuse treatment and the role of managed care. Several chapters deal with economic issues, cost-benefits, and - nancing of these services. Lastly, five address recent treatment outcome studies. Thus, this volume will be of great value to both scientists and practitioners. The Editor and Associate Editors are congratulated for this conceptual and organi- tional accomplishment.

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">The Powers Phase Project was a multiyear archaeological program undertaken in southeastern Missouri by the University of Michigan in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The project focused on the occupation of a large Pleistocene-age terrace in the Little Black River Lowland—a large expanse of lowlying land just east of the Ozark Highland—between roughly A. D. 1250 and A. D. 1400. The largest site in the region is Powers Fort—a palisaded mound center that - ceived archaeological attention as early as the late nineteenth century. Archa- logical surveys conducted south of Powers Fort in the 1960s revealed the pr- ence of numerous smaller sites of varying size that contained artifact assemblages similar to those from the larger center. Collectively the settlement aggregation became known as the Powers phase. Test excavations indicated that at least some of the smaller sites contained burned structures and that the burning had sealed household items on the floors below the collapsed architectural e- ments. Thus there appeared to be an opportunity to examine a late prehistoric settlement system to a degree not possible previously. Not only could the s- tial relation of communities in the system be ascertained, but the fact that str- tures within the communities had burned appeared to provide a unique opp- tunity to examine such things as differences in household items between and among structures and where various activities had occurred within a house. With these ideas in mind, James B. Griffin and James E.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">The aim of Language for those who have Nothing is to think psychiatry through the writings of Mikhail Bakhtin. Using the concepts of Dialogism and Polyphony, the Carnival and the Chronotope, a novel means of navigating the clinical landscape is developed. Bakhtin offers language as a social phenomenon and one that is fully embodied. Utterances are shown to be alive and enfleshed and their meanings realised in the context of given social dimensions. The organisation of this book corresponds with carnival practices of taking the high down to the low before replenishing its meaning anew. Thus early discussions of official language and the chronotope become exposed to descending levels of analysis and emphasis. Patients and practitioners are shown to occupy an entirely different spatio-temporal topography. These chronotopes have powerful borders and it is necessary to use the Carnival powers of cunning and deception in order to enter and to leave them. The book provides an overview of practitioners who have attempted such transgression and the author records his own unnerving experience as a pseudopatient. By exploring the context of psychiatry's unofficial voices: its terminology, jokes, parodies, and everyday narratives, the clinical landscape is shown to rely heavily on unofficial dialogues in order to safeguard an official identity.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">In this book I have concentrated on drawing attention to various conceptions of accountability that might be brought to bear in judging the practice of social research. Much of the book is organized around making explicit the assumptions that influence what counts as “proper” research in society, including assumptions about how social inquirers might be held accountable. My focus is on reviewing discourses around the practice of “professional” inquiry, with a view to reconsidering the way in which people create expectations for accountable social inquiry. My focus hereon is related to my concern that the manner in which judgments about researchers’ accountability are made, is not without social consequences for our way of living in society. I have approached the issues by beginning with a discussion of tenets of the position called “positivism” (so named by certain proponents), and by considering the view on accountability that is implied by adherence to these tenets. Briefly expressed, positivist argumentation suggests that researchers are required to “do science” in a manner that warrants their being considered, indeed, scientists. I use my discussion of accountability as seen within positivist argumentation to explicate ways in which alternative positions have arisen as ways of treating accountability issues. Through my way of comparing the various positions, I hope to provide some indication of the complexity ofethical and accountability issues in social inquiry.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Child sexual abuse has become a prevalent topic of study and discussion in the fields of Child Psychology, Pediatrics, Law Enforcement, and Social Work. But even with the widespread knowledge of identifiable behavior in its victims and abusers, society's response to child sexual abuse is failing profoundly. Rebecca Bolen's authoritative book, Child Sexual Abuse: Its Scope and Our Failure, clearly defines the scope of child sexual abuse and addresses society's ability to respond to the problem. It is her thesis that society's response to child sexual abuse is failing because the policies, programs, and statutes designed to assess and identify abuse are grounded in historical and myth-bound theoretical child sexual abuse literature rather than in the empirical knowledge base. This comprehensive text on child sexual abuse covers: The historical conceptualization of child sexual abuse, starting with Freud. A review of the empirical literature on the incidence and prevalence of child sexual abuse. The professional response to child sexual abuse. The most sophisticated model of risk of child sexual abuse done to date. Two new models of understanding reactions by nonoffending guardians. The pervasiveness of the threat of extrafamilial abuse. £/LIST£ This text is divided into three main areas of discussion: Sociohistorical Context, Scope of the Problem, and Aftermath. This comprehensive review can be used not only as a text, but also as a primary reference for professionals in government, law enforcement, medical, mental health, and any agency that works with child sexual abuse offenders and victims.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Mathematics is the science of acts without things - and through this, of things one can define by acts. 1 Paul Valéry The essays collected in this volume form a mosaik of theory, research, and practice directed at the task of spreading mathematical knowledge. They address questions raised by the recurrent observation that, all too frequently, the present ways and means of teaching mathematics generate in the student a lasting aversion against numbers, rather than an understanding of the useful and sometimes enchanting things one can do with them. Parents, teachers, and researchers in the field of education are well aware of this dismal situation, but their views about what causes the wide-spread failure and what steps should be taken to correct it have so far not come anywhere near a practicable consensus. The authors of the chapters in this book have all had extensive experience in teaching as well as in educational research. They approach the problems they have isolated from their own individual perspectives. Yet, they share both an overall goal and a specific fundamental conviction that characterized the efforts about which they write here. The common goal is to find a better way to teach mathematics. The common conviction is that knowledge cannot simply be transferred ready-made from parent to child or from teacher to student but has to be actively built up by each learner in his or her own mind.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">This book is a product of love and respect. If that sounds rather odd I initially apologise, but let me explain why I use those words. The original manuscript was of course Freudenthal’s, but his colleagues have carried the project through to its conclusion with love for the man, and his ideas, and with a respect developed over years of communal effort. Their invitation to me to write this Preface e- bles me to pay my respects to the great man, although I am probably incurring his wrath for writing a Preface for his book without his permission! I just hope he understands the feelings of all colleagues engaged in this particular project. Hans Freudenthal died on October 13th, 1990 when this book project was well in hand. In fact he wrote to me in April 1988, saying “I am thinking about a new book. I have got the sub-title (China Lectures) though I still lack a title”. I was astonished. He had retired in 1975, but of course he kept working. Then in 1985 we had been helping him celebrate his 80th birthday, and although I said in an Editorial Statement in Educational Studies in Mathematics (ESM) at the time “we look forward to him enjoying many more years of non-retirement” I did not expect to see another lengthy manuscript.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Advanced Mathematical Thinking has played a central role in the development of human civilization for over two millennia. Yet in all that time the serious study of the nature of advanced mathematical thinking – what it is, how it functions in the minds of expert mathematicians, how it can be encouraged and improved in the developing minds of students – has been limited to the reflections of a few significant individuals scattered throughout the history of mathematics. In the twentieth century the theory of mathematical education during the compulsory years of schooling to age 16 has developed its own body of empirical research, theory and practice. But the extensions of such theories to more advanced levels have only occurred in the last few years. In 1976 The International Group for the Psychology of Mathematics (known as PME) was formed and has met annually at different venues round the world to share research ideas. In 1985 a Working Group of PME was formed to focus on Advanced Mathematical Thinking with a major aim of producing this volume. The text begins with an introductory chapter on the psychology of advanced mathema- cal thinking, with the remaining chapters grouped under three headings: • the nature of advanced mathematical thinking, • cognitive theory, and • reviews of the progress of cognitive research into different areas of advanced mathematics.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Didactics of Mathematics as a Scientific Discipline describes the state of the art in a new branch of science. Starting from a general perspective on the didactics of mathematics, the 30 original contributions to the book, drawn from 10 different countries, go on to identify certain subdisciplines and suggest an overall structure or `topology' of the field. The book is divided into eight sections: (1) Preparing Mathematics for Students; (2) Teacher Education and Research on Teaching; (3) Interaction in the Classroom; (4) Technology and Mathematics Education; (5) Psychology of Mathematical Thinking; (6) Differential Didactics; (7) History and Epistemology of Mathematics and Mathematics Education; (8) Cultural Framing of Teaching and Learning Mathematics. Didactics of Mathematics as a Scientific Discipline is required reading for all researchers into the didactics of mathematics, and contains surveys and a variety of stimulating reflections which make it extremely useful for mathematics educators and teacher trainers interested in the theory of their practice. Future and practising teachers of mathematics will find much to interest them in relation to their daily work, especially as it relates to the teaching of different age groups and ability ranges. The book is also recommended to researchers in neighbouring disciplines, such as mathematics itself, general education, educational psychology and cognitive science.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">THE REAL WORLD OF MATHEMATICS, SCIENCE, AND TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION In this Preface, I would like to focus on what I mean by “education” and speak about the models and metaphors that are used when people talk, write, and act in the domain of education. We need to look at the assu- tions and processes that the models and metaphors implicitly and explicitly contain. I feel we should explore whether there is a specific thrust to mat- matics education in the here and now, and be very practical about it. For me education is the enhancement of knowledge and understanding, and there is a strong and unbreakable link between the two. There seems l- tle point in acquiring knowledge without understanding its meaning. Nor is it enough to gain a deep understanding of problems without gaining the appropriate knowledge to work for their solution. Thus knowledge and understanding are each necessary conditions for the process of education, but only when they are linked will the process bear fruit. Only in the b- anced interplay of knowledge and understanding can we expect to achieve genuine education.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">This book, based on detailed studies of eight innovations in mathematics and science education, has many insights to offer on current school reform. Since each innovation studied has taken its own unique approach, the set as a whole spans the spectrum from curriculum development to systemic reform, from c- centrating on particular school populations to addressing all of K-12 education. Yet these reform projects share a common context, a world view on what m- ters in science and mathematics for students of the 1990s and beyond, conv- tions about what constitutes effective instruction, and some notions about how school change can be brought about. These commonalities are drawn out in the book and illustrated with examples from the individual case studies that are reportedin full in BoldVentures, Volumes 2 and 3. The eight innovations—all of them projects that are well-known, at least by name, to U. S. audiences—are briefly described in chapter 1. Each was the s- ject of an in-depth, three-year case study. The research teams analyzed many documents, attended numerous project meetings, visited multiple sites, condu- ed dozens of individual interviews. The team leaders, having spent much time with mathematics or science education over long careers, looked at these reform projects through several lenses; the teams sifted through the mountains of data they had collected in order to tell the story of each project in rich detail.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Characterizing Pedagogical Flow presents conclusions from a multi-disciplinary, multi-national research project blending quantitative and qualitative approaches through a discourse methodology. The work produced portraits of mathematics and science education that were dramatically different for each of the countries involved: France, Japan, Norway, Spain, Switzerland, and the United States. To explain these differences, it is proposed that the interaction of curriculum and pedagogy is culturally unique and yields classroom learning experiences that are qualitatively different from country to country. This idea has profound implications for how international education research is interpreted.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">PREFACE The Third International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS), sponsored by the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA) and the g- ernments of the participating countries, is acomparative study of education in mathematics and the sciences conducted in approximately 50 educational systems on six continents. The goal of TIMSS is to measure student achievement in mathematics and science in participating countries and to assess some of the curricular and classroom factors that are related to student learning in these subjects. The study is intended to provide educators and policy makers with an unpar- leled and multidimensional perspective on mathematics and science curricula; their implem- tation; the nature of student performance in mathematics and science; and the social, econ- ic, and educational context in which these occur. TIMSS focuses on student learning and achievement in mathematics and science at three different age levels, or populations. • Population 1 is defined as all students enrolled in the two adjacent grades that contain the largest proportion of 9-year-old students; • Population 2 is defined as all students enrolled in the two adjacent grades that contain the largest proportion of 13-year-old students; and • Population 3 is defined as all students in their final year of secondary education, incl- ing students in vocational education programs. In addition, Population 3 has two “specialist” subpopulations: students taking advanced courses in mathematics (mathematics specialists), and students taking advanced courses in physics (physics specialists).</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">A Splintered Vision: An Investigation of U.S. Science and Mathematics Education is the US report on the curriculum analysis component of the Third International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) which was sponsored by the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA). The report summarizes data from the TIMSS curriculum analysis and integrates it with teacher questionnaire data from the US, Japan, and Germany on science and mathematics topic coverage and instructional practices. The authors of A Splintered Vision discuss and provide evidence of the unfocused nature of US mathematics and science curricular intentions, textbooks, and teacher practices. They offer the premise that producers of US textbooks and curriculum guides have attempted to answer calls for curricular reform by adding new content to already existing materials instead of devoting time to restructuring the materials. The authors also suggest that US teachers, inundated with a myriad of competing visions, are attempting to cover all the topics they confront in their resource documents and to meet all the instructional demands placed on them by those with a stake in education. In keeping with the `incremental assembly line' philosophy in American society, US teachers also tend to lean toward a piecemeal approach to education. The authors speculate on what such practices may mean for the mathematics and science achievement of US students. The work is sure to spur discussion among educational researchers, policy makers, and others concerned about the future of mathematics and science education in the US.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Suicide Prevention: A Holistic Approach contains the selected and edited papers that were presented during the congress Suicide, Disease, Disadvantage, A Holistic Approach, organized by the International Association for Suicide Prevention, which was held in June 1995, in Venice. Suicide prevention is still sadly neglected by governments and public health authorities, despite the fact that in several Western countries suicide has become the primary cause of death among younger age groups. The selected papers express the need for a holistic viewpoint in suicide management. The subjects range from parasuicide to the role of the media, from the special type of psychotherapeutic approach required to the most recent guidelines in pharmacological treatment, from a homage to the memory of Erwin Ringel to the presentation of specific national prevention schemes. The book will be of interest to public health workers, doctors, psychologists and social workers, as well as voluntary staff and their organizations, and to all those who make suicide prevention one of their primary interests.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">On the occasion of the celebration of “Twenty Years of Didactique of Ma- ematics” in France, Jeremy Kilpatrick commented that though the works of Guy Brousseau are known through texts referring to them or mentioning their existence, the original texts are unknown, or known only with difficulty, in the non-Fren- speaking world. With very few exceptions, what has been available until now have been interpretations of the works of Brousseau rather than the works themselves. It was in response to this need that two of us, in the euphoria of an unforgettable Mexican evening at the time of the 1990 PME conference, decided to undertake the task of translating into English most of the works of Guy Brousseau. The ceuvre is immense, and once past the initial moments ofenthusiasm, with the accompanying ambition to produce the entire of it, we recognized the need to choose both the texts and a method of proceeding. As far as the texts go, we chose to take the period from 1970 to 1990, in the course of which it seemed to us that Brousseau had forged the essentials of the Theory of Didactical Situations. But even there the collection is huge. So, after an initial translation of most of the publications of the period, we carved out a selection, retaining the texts which gave the best presentation of the principles and key concepts of the Theory.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">`Contemporary thinking on philosophy and the social sciences has been dominated by analyses that emphasise the importance of language in understanding societies and individuals functioning within them; important developments which have been under-utilised by researchers in mathematics education. This book reaches out to contemporary work in these broader fields; drawing on original sources in key areas such as Gadamer and Ricoeur's development of hermeneutics, Habermas' work in critical social theory, Schutz's social phenomenology, Saussure's linguistics and the post-structuralist analysis of Derrida, Foucault and Barthes. Through examining the writings of these major thinkers it is shown how language is necessarily instrumental in developing mathematical understanding; but a language that is in a permanent state of becoming, resisting stable connections to the ideas it locates. The analysis offered extends from children doing mathematics to teachers inspecting and developing their own professional practices.'</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Ourpredilection for premature acceptance and assertion, ouraversionto suspendedjudgment, are signs that we tend naturally to cut short the process oftesting. We are satisfied with superficial and immediate sho- visioned applications. . . . Science represents the safeguard ofthe race againstthese natural propensities and theevilswhich flow fromthem. . . . It isartificial (an acquired art), notspontaneous; learned, notnative. To this fact is due the unique, the invaluable place of science in education. (Dewey 1916, p. 189) Some, with a more narrow focus, maintain that if we want students to learn and become competent in science, then they must be taught something about the nature of science. For instance, Frederick Reif in a recent publication, has said: Alltoo often introductory physics courses ‘cover’ numerous topics, but theknowledge actually acquired by students is often nominal ratherthan functional. If students are to acquire basic physics knowledge. . . It is necessary to understand better the requisite thought processes and to teach these more explicitly. . . . if one wants to improve significantly students’ learning of physics. . . . It is also necessary to modify students’ naive notions about the nature of science. (Reif 1995, p. 281) Curriculum documents in the US (especially Project 2061 and the National Science Standards), Canada (especially Science for Every Student), and Europe (particularly those from UK, Denmark, and Spain) are giving increased prominence to students understanding the nature of science.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Facing the Consequences presents a perspective on US mathematics and science education that is developed from data gathered as part of the Third International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS). TIMSS is the most extensive and far-reaching cross-national comparative study of mathematics and science education ever attempted. It includes comparing official curricula, textbooks, teacher practices, and student achievements for many countries (from 20 to 50 countries, depending on the particular comparison). Thousands of official documents and textbooks were analyzed. Thousands of teachers, principals, and other experts responded to survey questionnaires. A sample of mathematics teachers in three countries had their lessons videotaped. Hundreds of thousands of children in almost 50 countries were tested in mathematics and science. This report presents a closer look at US mathematics and science education through careful examination of TIMSS data. The authors believe this investigation shows how deceptive many often unquestioned assumptions about American education can be. Drawing upon many new analyses not previously reported and integrating these with previous analyses of TIMSS data, the authors develop and illustrate the argument that what happens to American students is the consequence of American beliefs that shape educational practice and the accretion of a myriad educational choices made in mathematics and science education.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Since its emergence over two decades ago, the construct of pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) has significantly impacted preservice and inservice teacher education, educational policy, and educational research. PCK has served to re-focus educators' attention on the important role of subject matter in educational practice and away from the more generic approach to teacher education that dominated the field prior to 1975. This ambitious text is the first of its kind to summarize the theory, research, and practice related to pedagogical content knowledge. The audience is provided with a functional understanding of the basic tenets of the construct as well as its applications to research on science teacher education and the development of science teacher education programs. The authors are prominent educators representing a variety of subject matter areas and K-12 grade levels. Although the focus of the text is science education, it should provide valuable reading for any individuals with interests in professional teacher education.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Teachers' Learning: Stories of Science Education is aimed at science educators who wish for a deeper understanding of how teachers learn to teach science and the role of stories in reporting science education research. It is a fascinating look at the knowledge teachers have and use, how context influences teachers' work, and the role of reflection and collaboration in teachers' learning. At the core of each chapter is a story or group of stories written by or about teachers. These stories serve as a form of data to build a set of arguments about how science teachers grow and the possibilities for change in teaching. This book is designed for all those involved in the science teaching enterprise. Pre-service teachers, graduate students and science education researchers are invited to utilise both the findings about teachers' learning and the research processes employed to develop those findings.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Diane Shorrocks-Taylor School of Education, University of Leeds,UK In September 1998, a conference was held at the University of Leeds entitled ‘International comparisons of pupil performance: issues and policy’. It was arranged by two groups within the School of Education at the University, the newly formed Assessment and Evaluation Unit and the Centre for Studies in Science and Mathematics Education. Thejoint interest in international comparisons of performance had itself arisen from earlier involvement in a follow-up study of the 1995 TIMSS work in England, reported in a later chapter in this book, in which the TIMSS assessment outcomes were studied alongside the outcomes from the National Curriculum testing programme in England. Some of the results of this investigation had proved both interesting and challenging so the decision was made to promote wider discussion of some key issues by inviting contributors from all over the world to a meeting the major aims of which were to promote an exploration of : - the theoretical foundations of international comparative studies of student performance; - the practical problems of carrying out such studies; - the appropriateness of the assessment models and approaches used in international comparisons; - the role of international comparative studies in raising standards of student performance; - and how international studies affect the shaping of national policy on education.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Analysis of past developments in teacher education in Pakistan has shown that substantial progress has been made in this field. It has, however, been pointed out that education of science teachers still needs much improvement. At the present, there is an emergent need to meet the shortage of qualified science teachers and at the same time to bring qualitative improvements in the courses offered in teacher education institutions. First, we recommend that the 1-year duration of teacher preparation is grossly inadequate for all teaching courses, and should be lengthened, and the qualifications for entrance be increased. We believe that teaching must be made a graduate profession. For example, the basic qualification of primary school teachers for admission to teacher education institution should be increased. We recommend that PTC should be made a 12 + 2 year program. Similarly, CT, 12 + 3; B. Ed. , 14 + 2; B. S. Ed. , 12 + 4; M. A. Ed. , 14 + 3; and M. Ed. one year after B. Ed. or B. S. Ed. Secondly, we think the quality of instruction in teacher preparation programs should be improved. Most teachers in the teacher preparation institutions use the lecture method most of the time. Prospective teachers behave like passive listeners to their teachers. They do not participate in the teaching/ learning process. Some instructors even dictate their notes to the preservice teachers. When the teachers join schools, they behave the same way.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">This book confronts the issue of how young people can find a way into the world of algebra. The contributions represent multiple perspectives which include an analysis of situations in which algebra is an efficient problem-solving tool, the use of computer-based technologies, and a consideration of the historical evolution of algebra. The book emphasises the situated nature of algebraic activity as opposed to being concerned with identifying students' conceptions in isolation from problem-solving activity. The chapters emerged from a working group of the International Group for the Psychology of Mathematics Education. The authors are drawn from an international community and the work highlights the differences in school algebra around the world. The group invited Nicolas Balacheff to write a provocative postscript and he suggests that `there is no possible entrance to the world of algebra without a strong push or guidance from the teacher, because there is no natural passage from the problématique accessible from the child's world to the mathematical problématique'.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">To a large extent, it lies, no doubt, in what is presented in this work under the title of ‘meta lever‘, a method which it is certainly interesting to develop and further refine. There exists in mathematics courses a strange prudery which forbids one to ask questions such as, ‹‹ Why are we doing this? », ‹‹ At what is the objective aimed? », whereas it is usually easy to reply to such questions, to keep them in mind, and to show that one can challenge these questions and modify the objectives to be more productive or more useful. If we don‘t do this we give a false impression of a gratuitous or arbitrary interpretation of a discipline whose rules are far from being unmotivated or unfounded. One must also consider the time aspect. Simple ideas take a long time to be conceived. Should we not therefore allow the students time to familiarize themselves with new notions? And must we not also recognize that this length of time is generally longer than that ofthe official length of time accorded to this teaching and that we should be counting in years? When the rudiments of linear algebra were taught at the level of the lycée (college level), the task of first year university teachers was certainly easier : for sure the student's knowledge was not very deep, however it was not negligible and it allowed them to reach a deeper understanding more quickly.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Mapping Biology Knowledge addresses two key topics in the context of biology, promoting meaningful learning and knowledge mapping as a strategy for achieving this goal. Meaning-making and meaning-building are examined from multiple perspectives throughout the book. In many biology courses, students become so mired in detail that they fail to grasp the big picture. Various strategies are proposed for helping instructors focus on the big picture, using the `need to know' principle to decide the level of detail students must have in a given situation. The metacognitive tools described here serve as support systems for the mind, creating an arena in which learners can operate on ideas. They include concept maps, cluster maps, webs, semantic networks, and conceptual graphs. These tools, compared and contrasted in this book, are also useful for building and assessing students' content and cognitive skills. The expanding role of computers in mapping biology knowledge is also explored.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Formative Assessment and Science Education documents the findings of a research project which investigated the ways in which teachers and students used formative assessment to improve the teaching and learning of science in some New Zealand classrooms. The research documented in this book used the definition of formative assessment as `the process used by teachers and students to recognise and respond to students' learning, in order to enhance that learning, during the learning'. The book contains one detailed case study from the research, as well as cameos of instances of formative assessment. The book also contains two summaries of the research findings - a model developed to describe the process of formative assessment used by the teachers and students involved in the research, and a summary of the characteristics of formative assessment. The findings are also theorised with respect to sociocultural and discursive views of learning. This research will be of interest to graduate students and researchers, as well as teacher educators, curriculum developers, and assessment specialists.</dcvalue>

The result is a variegated picture of science and mathematics classrooms that challenges a research tradition that converges on the truth. In this book, we surround you with different images of the classroom. It is hoped that some will address issues of interest, some will confirm beliefs you have long held, some will challenge these same beliefs, and some may surprise you. The resulting account should appeal to educational researchers, research students, and practitioners with an interest in optimising the effectiveness of classrooms as environments for learning.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Increasingly, teachers all over the world are grappling on a daily basis with the fact of multilingual classrooms. In this book, Jill Adler captures three inter-related dilemmas that lie at the heart of teaching mathematics in multilingual classrooms. Adler's identification and naming of the dilemma of code-switching, the dilemma of mediation, and the dilemma of transparency, arise from exploring the realities of actual classrooms, and are shaped by a perspective of teaching as a social practice. Adler provides a sharp analysis and strong theoretical grounding for her work, pulling together research related to the relationship between language and mathematics, communicating mathematics, and mathematics in bi-/multilingual settings. In so doing, she offers a direct challenge to dominant research on communication in mathematics classrooms that has `othered' the multilingual setting in its normalisation of the monolingual classroom. The `norm' is a multicultural one. Set in contemporary South Africa - a context of linguistic diversity and rapid change - this book offers a spotlight whose beam is wide enough to illuminate dilemmas at work in all mathematics classrooms.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">1 Wolff Michael Roth &amp; Derrick R. Lavoie² 1 2 University of Victoria, Virtual Institute for Learning Resources The current reform in science education requires a substantive change in how science is taught. Implicit in this reform is an equally substantive change in professional devel- ment practices at all levels. (NRC, 1996,p. 56) In a continuously changing society, it is not surprising that education also undergoes continuous change. Science education is no exception, and perhaps changes are more rapid given the daily construction of new scientific knowledge. In such a c- mate of continuous change, the preparation of science teachers has to follow suit in order to be appropriate to the reforms that national organizations encourage. H- ever, whereas science teaching reform movements spawned recommendations of what teachers should know and be able to do in order for their students to concep- alize and process science (NSTA, 1997), they provide little guidance in terms of - the-classroom concrete implementation. Thus, while national science education organizations continue to refine their positions about teacher education, there is no mechanism for translating these positions and statements into science education courses that can improve the preparation and quality of p- service science teachers at both the elementary and secondary levels. (Yager &amp; Penick, 1990. p. 670) It is therefore not surprising that there are voices that describe teacher prepa- tion as unsuccessful and as unresponsive to reform efforts (Schnur &amp; Golby, 1995).</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">This book is the final report of the ICMI study on the Teaching and Learning of Mathematics at University Level. As such it is one of a number of such studies that ICMI has commissioned. The other Study Volumes cover assessment in mathematics education, gender equity, research in mathematics education, the teaching of geometry, and history in mathematics education. All ofthese Study Volumes represent a statement of the state of the art in their respective areas. We hope that this is also the case for the current Study Volume. The current study on university level mathematics was commissioned for essentially four reasons. First, universities world-wide are accepting a much larger and more diverse group of students than has been the case. Consequently, universities have begun to adopt a role more like that of the school system and less like the elite institutions of the past. As a result the educational and pedagogical issues facing universities have changed. Second, although university student numbers have increased significantly, there has not been a corresponding increase in the number of mathematics majors. Hence mathematics departments have to be more aware of their students’ needs in order to retain the students they have and to attract future students. As part of this awareness, departments of mathematics have to take the teaching and learning of mathematics more seriously than perhaps they have in the past.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Nicotine is almost universally believed to be the major factor that motivates smoking and impedes cessation. Authorities such as the Surgeon General of the USA and the Royal College of Physicians in the UK have declared that nicotine is as addictive as heroin and cocaine. This book is a critique of the nicotine addiction hypothesis, based on a critical review of the research literature that purports to prove that nicotine is as addictive drug. The review is based on a re-examination of more than 700 articles and books on this subject, including animal and human experimental studies, effects of `nicotine replacement therapies', and many other relevant sources. This review concludes that on present evidence, there is every reason to reject the generally accepted theory that nicotine has a major role in cigarette smoking. A critical examination of the criteria for drug addiction demonstrates that none of these criteria is met by nicotine, and that it is much more likely that nicotine in fact limits rather than facilitates smoking.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Suicide kills and maims victims; traumatizes loved ones; preoccupies clinicians; and costs health care and emergency agencies fortunes. It should therefore demand a wealth of theoretical, scientific, and fiduciary attention. But in many ways it has Why? Although the answer to this question is multi-faceted, this volume not. supposes that one answer to the question is a lack of elaborated and penetrating theoretical approaches. The authors of this volume were challenged to apply their considerable theoretical wherewithal to this state of affairs. They have risen to this challenge admirably, in that several ambitious ideas are presented and developed. Ifever a phenomenon should inspire humility, it is suicide, and the volume’s authors realize this. Although several far-reaching views are proposed, they are pitched as first approximations, with the primary goal of stimulating still more conceptual and empirical work. A pressing issue in suicide science is the topic of clinical interventions, and clinical approaches more generally. Here too, this volume contributes, covering such topics as therapeutics and prevention, comorbidity, special populations, and clinicalrisk factors.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">A title that sounds like poetry, and a subtitle that seems to contradict the title! But the subtitle is right, and originally it was just the title. A strange subtitle, isn’t it? Preface to a Science of Mathematical Education. All sciences – in their prenatal stage – have known this kind of literature: only the term used was not ‘Preface’, but, for instance, ‘Prolegomena’, which * means the same though it sounds less provisional. In fact such works were thicker than the present one, by up to ten times. There is much more that can be said about a science before it comes into being than after; with the first results comes modesty. This is the preface to a book that will never be written: not by me, nor by anybody else. Once a science of mathematical education exists, it will get the preface it deserves. Nevertheless this preface – or what for honesty’s sake I have labelled so – must fulfil a function: the function of accelerating the birth of a science of mathematical education, which is seriously impeded by the unfounded view that such already exists. Against this view I have to argue: it rests on a wrong estimation – both over and under estimation at the same time – of what is to be considered as science.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">The launch ofa new book series is always a challenging eventn ot only for the Editorial Board and the Publisher, but also, and more particularly, for the first author. Both the Editorial Board and the Publisher are delightedt hat the first author in this series isw ell able to meet the challenge. Professor Freudenthal needs no introduction toanyone in the Mathematics Education field and it is particularly fitting that his book should be the first in this new series because it was in 1968 that he, and Reidel, produced the first issue oft he journal Edu cational Studies in Mathematics. Breakingfresh ground is therefore nothing new to Professor Freudenthal and this book illustrates well his pleasure at such a task. To be strictly correct the ‘ground’ which he has broken here is not new, but aswith Mathematics as an Educational Task and Weeding and Sowing, it is rather the novelty oft he manner in which he has carried out his analysis which provides us with so many fresh perspectives. It is our intention that this new book series should provide those who work int he emerging discipline of mathematicseducation with an essential resource, and at a time of considerable concern about the whole mathematics cu rriculum this book represents just such resource.

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">The development of knowledge is never easy. One doesn’t want to go over old ground again, but yet one needs to establish the new in the context of the old. One is also anxious about the novelty of the ideas are they new enough, or are they too ‘way out’ to be acceptable? In some fields perhaps these criteria are less important than in others. In education, I sense that ‘novelty’ is a tricky criterion, varying in value from society to society. In some societies the new ideas have to justify their adoption in the face to the old, tried and tested ideas. (Better the devil you know than the devil you don’t!) In other societies the old ways have to justify their continuation in the face of the new, promising and exciting ideas. (I can’t find a good proverb for this! Perhaps proverbs are all about preserving the past?) In any case, some people will argue, there is nothing new to be said about education anyway the problems are the same and it is only the context which changes. Mellin Olsen develops the reader’s knowledge through this book in ways that are both novel and challenging. Their novelty is not in question, judging by reactions to them which vary from “they have nothing to do with mathematics education” to “they concern everything that is done in mathematics education”.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">In writing the present book I have had in mind the following objectives: - To propose a theoretical, comprehensive view of the domain of intuition. - To identify and organize the experimental findings related to intuition scattered in a wide variety of research contexts. - To reveal the educational implications of the idea, developed for science and mathematics education. Most of the existing monographs in the field of intuition are mainly concerned with theoretical debates - definitions, philosophical attitudes, historical considerations. (See, especially the works of Wild (1938), of Bunge (1 962) and of Noddings and Shore (1 984).) A notable exception is the book by Westcott (1968), which combines theoretical analyses with the author’s own experimental studies. But, so far, no attempt has been made to identify systematically those findings, spread throughout the research literature, which could contribute to the deciphering of the mechanisms of intuition. Very often the relevant studies do not refer explicitly to intuition. Even when this term is used it occurs, usually, as a self-evident, common sense term.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">CMOS Data Converters for Communications distinguishes itself from other data converter books by emphasizing system-related aspects of the design and frequency-domain measures. It explains in detail how to derive data converter requirements for a given communication system (baseband, passband, and multi-carrier systems). The authors also review CMOS data converter architectures and discuss their suitability for communications. The rest of the book is dedicated to high-performance CMOS data converter architecture and circuit design. Pipelined ADCs, parallel ADCs with an improved passive sampling technique, and oversampling ADCs are the focus for ADC architectures, while current-steering DAC modeling and implementation are the focus for DAC architectures. The principles of the switched-current and the switched-capacitor techniques are reviewed and their applications to crucial functional blocks such as multiplying DACs and integrators are detailed. The book outlines the design of the basic building blocks such as operational amplifiers, comparators, and reference generators with emphasis on the practical aspects. To operate analog circuits at a reduced supply voltage, special circuit techniques are needed. Low-voltage techniques are also discussed in this book. CMOS Data Converters for Communications can be used as a reference book by analog circuit designers to understand the data converter requirements for communication applications. It can also be used by telecommunication system designers to understand the difficulties of certain performance requirements on data converters. It is also an excellent resource to prepare analog students for the new challenges ahead.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">“Wireless is coming” was the message received by VLSI designers in the early 1990’s. They believed it. But they never imagined that the wireless wave would be coming with such intensity and speed. Today one of the most challenging areas for VLSI designers is VLSI circuit and system design for wireless applications. New generation of wireless systems, which includes multimedia, put severe constraints on performance, cost, size, power and energy. The challenge is immense and the need for new generation of VLSI designers, who are fluent in wireless communication and are masters of mixed signal design, is great. No single text or reference book contains the necessary material to educate such needed new generation of VLSIdesigners. There are gaps. Excellent books exist on communication theory and systems, including wireless applications and others treat well basic digital, analog and mixed signal VLSI design. We feel that this book is the first of its kind to fill that gap. In the first half of this book we offer the reader (the VLSI designer) enough material to understand wireless communication systems. We start with a historical account. And then we present an overview of wireless communication systems. This is followed by detailed treatment of related topics; the mobile radio, digital modulation and schemes, spread spectrum and receiver architectures. The second half of the book deals with VLSI design issues related to mixed-signal design. These include analog-to-digital conversion, transceiver design, digital low-power techniques, amplifier design, phase locked loops and frequency synthesizers.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Multi-carrier technologies have emerged as important instruments in telecommunications. OFDM is in the forefront, with its adoption by the IEEE 802.11 standards committee and the European HYPERLAN standards group. Following OFDM, MC-CDMA is also demonstrating considerable promise when compared to competing technologies. According to the authors, these technologies are just the beginning in the coming multi-carrier revolution. In Multi-Carrier Technologies for Wireless Communication, the authors explain how a common multi-carrier platform is being designed for DS-CDMA, TDMA, OFDM and MC-CDMA systems. Findings are presented which show how this multi-carrier platform enhances network capacity and probability of error performance.Specific results include (1) innovation in multi-carrier technologies that are enabling them to become an integral part of TDMA and DS-CDMA systems; and (2) the design of multi-carrier systems to overcome PAPR problems (in, e.g., OFDM). Multi-Carrier Technologies for Wireless Communication is an important book for engineers who work with DS-CDMA, TDMA, OFDM, or MC-CDMA systems, and are seeking new ways of exploiting the wireless medium based on a "smarter" signal processing.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Multi-Standard CMOS Wireless Receivers: Analysis and Design is the first book on the subject of multi-standard wireless receivers. It covers both the analysis and design aspects of CMOS radio receivers with primary focus on receivers for mobile terminals. The subject of multi-standard data converter design for base stations is also covered. The book is the first to detail a complete analysis of a multi-standard receiver chain from the antenna to the data converter establishing the design specifications of all blocks in both the radio and mixed-signal parts. The specifications are conveniently tabulated throughout the book and span a level of details from the noise figure and linearity requirements of RF blocks down to such circuit details as, e.g., DC gain, settling behavior, noise and matching requirements of amplifiers (OTAs) in the data converter. Multi-Standard CMOS Wireless Receivers: Analysis and Design serves as a reference for RF IC and mixed-signal designers, wireless receiver system designers, design managers and project leaders in industry, particularly those in the wireless semiconductor industry.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">This book is a collection of extended versions of the papers presented at the Symposium on Next Generation Wireless Networks, May 26, 2000, New Jersey Institute of Technology, Newark, NJ. Each chapter includes, in addition to technical contributions, a tutorial of the corresponding area. It has been a privilege to bring together these contributions from researchers on the leading edge of the field. The papers were submitted in response to a call for papers aiming to concentrate on the applications and services for the “next generation,” deliberately omitting the numeric reference so that the authors’ vision of the future would not be limited by the definitive requirements of a particular set of standards. The book, as a result, reflects the top-down approach by focusing on enabling technologies for the applications and services that are the defining essentials for future wireless networks. This approach strikes a balance between the academia and the industry by addressing new wireless network architectures enabling mobility and location enhanced applications and services that will give wireless systems the competitive edge over others. The main theme of the book is the advent of wireless networks as an irreplaceable means of global communication as opposed to a mere substitute for, or a competitor of, wireline networks. Geolocation emerges as the facilitator of mobility and location sensitive services. The fields of geolocation and wireless communications have been forced to merge, following the Federal Commission of Communications’ (FCC) ruling that obliges wireless providers with emergency caller geolocation.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">With the rapidly increasing penetration of laptop computers and mobile phones, which are primarily used by mobile users to access Internet s- vices like e-mail and World Wide Web (WWW) access, support of Internet services in a mobile environment is an emerging requirement. Wireless n- works have been used for communication among fully distributed users in a multimedia environment that has the needs to provide real-time bursty traffic (such as voice or video) and data traffic with excellent reliability and service quality. To satisfy the huge wireless multimedia service demand and improve the system performance, efficient channel access methods and analytical methods must be provided. In this way very accurate models, that faithfully reproduce the stochastic behavior of multimedia wireless communication and computer networks, can be constructed. Most of these system models are discrete-time queueing systems. Queueing networks and Markov chains are commonly used for the p- formance and reliability evaluation of computer, communication, and m- ufacturing systems. Although there are quite a few books on the individual topics of queueing networks and Markov chains, we have found none that covers the topics of discrete-time and continuous-time multichannel mul- traffic queueing networks. On the other hand, the design and development of multichannel mul- hop network systems and interconnected network systems or integrated n- works of multimedia traffic require not only such average performance m- sures as the throughput or packet delay but also higher moments of traffic departures and transmission delay.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Due to the explosive global growth in the number of mobile subscribers, as well as the growth predicted in the mobile data segment, the need for improved spectrum efficiency on the radio interface becomes more and more important. Frequency hopping (FH) is an effective method for improving the spectrum efficiency. One of the advantages of FH is that it can be combined with other spectral efficiency improving features like power control, handover and reuse partitioning. Performance Enhancements in a Frequency Hopping GSM Network covers FH and some of the additional features in detail. It begins with an in-depth description of the basic concept of FH on link level as well as on system level. Different methods have been used for analysis, such as link level simulations, network level simulations and classic tele-traffic theory. Special features of Performance Enhancements in a Frequency Hopping GSM Network: Combines the practical experiences of operator and vendor with more theoretical research methods. An in-depth treatment of prevailing problems in GSM networks; Presentation of a new method, computer-aided network design (CAND), which has been developed to analyse the complex network structures of a GSM network. CAND provides the possibility for more realistic performance evaluations than conventional methods; Provides GSM-specific analysis of functionality improvements in power control, discontinuous transmission, and several handover algorithms; Explanation of the quality and capacity gains of features like the combination of FH and reuse partitioning, referred to as intelligent frequency hopping; A frequency planning method for FH GSM networks is presented. This method exploits the benefits from FH directly in the allocation process, increasing the overall frequency plan.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Phase-Locked Loops for Wireless Communications: Digitial, Analog and Optical Implementations, Second Edition presents a complete tutorial of phase-locked loops from analog implementations to digital and optical designs. The text establishes a thorough foundation of continuous-time analysis techniques and maintains a consistent notation as discrete-time and non-uniform sampling are presented. New to this edition is a complete treatment of charge pumps and the complementary sequential phase detector. Another important change is the increased use of MATLAB®, implemented to provide more familiar graphics and reader-derived phase-locked loop simulation. Frequency synthesizers and digital divider analysis/techniques have been added to this second edition. Perhaps most distinctive is the chapter on optical phase-locked loops that begins with sections discussing components such as lasers and photodetectors and finishing with homodyne and heterodyne loops. Starting with a historical overview, presenting analog, digital, and optical PLLs, discussing phase noise analysis, and including circuits/algorithms for data synchronization, this volume contains new techniques being used in this field. Highlights of the Second Edition: Development of phase-locked loops from analog to digital and optical, with consistent notation throughout; Expanded coverage of the loop filters used to design second and third order PLLs; Design examples on delay-locked loops used to synchronize circuits on CPUs and ASICS; New material on digital dividers that dominate a frequency synthesizer's noise floor. Techniques to analytically estimate the phase noise of a divider; Presentation of optical phase-locked loops with primers on the optical components and fundamentals of optical mixing; Section on automatic frequency control to provide frequency-locking of the lasers instead of phase-locking; Presentation of charge pumps, counters, and delay-locked loops. The Second Edition includes the essential topics needed by wireless, optics, and the traditional phase-locked loop specialists to design circuits and software algorithms. All of the material has been updated throughout the book.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Radio Resource Management in Cellular Systems is the first book to address the critical issue of radio resource management in emerging (i.e., third generation and beyond) wireless systems. This book presents novel approaches for the design of high performance handoff algorithms that exploit attractive features of several existing algorithms, provide adaptation to dynamic cellular environment, and allow systematic tradeoffs among different system characteristics. Efficient handoff algorithms cost-effectively enhance the capacity and quality of service (QoS) of cellular systems. A comprehensive foundation of handoff and related issues of cellular communications is given. Tutorial-type material on the general features of 3G and 3.5G wireless systems (including CDMA2000, UMTS, and 1xEV-DO) is provided. Key elements for the development of simulators to study handoff and overall RF performance of the integrated voice and data cellular systems (including those based on CDMA) are also described. Finally, the powerful design tools of neural networks and fuzzy logic are applied to wireless communications, so that the generic algorithm approaches proposed in the book can be applied to many other design and development areas. The simulation models described in the book represent a single source that provides information for the performance evaluation of systems from handoff and resource management perspectives. Radio Resource Management in Cellular Systems will prove a valuable resource for system designers and practicing engineers working on design and development of third generation (and beyond) wireless systems. It may also be used as a text for advanced-level courses in wireless communications and neural networks.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Radio network system planning is a comprehensive optimisation task where different planning targets - coverage, capacity and quality- have a direct influence on each other and where optimised solution is a compromise of these planning areas. In order to find out the cost effective and high quality radio network plan the well-known theoretical details have to be bound with practical radio planning issues like planning phases and planning parameters. At the same time the long-term network evolution paths and the possible changes of the radio propagation environment have to be well understood. Radio Interface System Planning for GSM/GPRS/UMTS introduces the radio system planning where these theoretical and practical details have both been emphasized and then utilized for the planning of GSM, GPRS and UMTS mobile networks. The key planning parameters for these systems are explained and the typical values for power budget, various margins, gains and losses, and frequency reuse are given. Also, the book describes the common tasks in radio system planning. The planning methods and phases introduced in the book can also be applied to other mobile communication systems.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">RF CMOS Power Amplifiers: Theory Design and Implementation focuses on the design procedure and the testing issues of CMOS RF power amplifiers. This is the first monograph addressing RF CMOS power amplifier design for emerging wireless standards. The focus on power amplifiers for short is distance wireless personal and local area networks (PAN and LAN), however the design techniques are also applicable to emerging wide area networks (WAN) infrastructure using micro or pico cell networks. The book discusses CMOS power amplifier design principles and theory and describes the architectures and tardeoffs in designing linear and nonlinear power amplifiers. It then details design examples of RF CMOS power amplifiers for short distance wireless applications (e, g., Bluetooth, WLAN) including designs for multi-standard platforms. Design aspects of RF circuits in deep submicron CMOS are also discussed. RF CMOS Power Amplifiers: Theory Design and Implementation serves as a reference for RF IC design engineers and RD and R&amp;D managers in industry, and for graduate students conducting research in wireless semiconductor IC design in general and with CMOS technology in particular.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">This book concerns two major topics, smart antenna systems and wireless local-area-networks (LANs). For smart antenna systems, it d- cusses the mechanics behind a smart antenna system, the setup of a smart antenna experimental testbed, and experimental and computer simulation results of various issues relating to smart antenna systems. For wireless LAN systems, it discusses the IEEE 802.11 worldwide wi- less LAN standard, the operation of a wireless LAN system, and some of the technical considerations that must be overcome by a wireless LAN system designer. These two topics are combined in the discussion of the Smart Wireless LAN (SWL) system, which was designed to achieve the benefits which smart antenna systems can provide for wireless LAN systems while still remaining compatible with the 802.11 wireless LAN standard. The design of SWL calls for the replacement of the conv- tional wireless LAN base station (which are called access points in the 802.11 documentation) with an SWL base station, while leaving the - dividual terminal operation as unchanged as possible.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs) are experiencing a growing importance recently. Whereas WLANs were primarily used for niche applications in the past, they are now deployed as wireless extensions to computer networks. The increase of the datarates from 2 Mbps up to 11 Mbps for roughly a constant price has played a major role in this breakthrough. As a consequence, an even greater success can be envisioned for the more recent OFDM-based WLAN standards in the 5 GHz band that offer up to 54 Mbps. At IMEC we have realized this potential already several years ago and have established a successful research program on OFDM-based WLAN. The program resulted in an operational prototype of a 5 GHz OFDM system. The longer term goals of this program are to extend the indoor range of the WLAN systems up to 100 m and to increase the capacity above 100 Mbps. Driven by these goals, Patrick embarked on the usage of multiple antenna techniques and, more in particular, Space Division Multiple Access (SDMA) for WLAN as the topic for his doctoral research. During this research, key contributions were made towards making SDMA for WLAN a reality. To name a few: A basic scheme for combining OFDM and SDMA was proposed. Also realistic non-linear detection methods were developed. These me- ods achieve a high implementation efficiency, by exploiting the p- allelism of the data model and the frequency-selectivity of the pr- agation channel.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Space-Time Processing for CDMA Mobile Communications is one of the first books to: bring together spatial/temporal channel models and analytic performance evaluation techniques; establish a link between smart antenna systems and advanced receiver design techniques; treat smart antennas specifically for UMTS-like communication systems, with applicable simulations and calculations; supply code with Matlab® GUI so readers can run or modify existing simulations or create new ones. The field of smart antenna technology or, more generally, space-time processing is rapidly becoming one of the most promising areas of mobile communications, especially regarding the development of the first practical third-generation mobile communication systems. The authors have addressed many of the most basic questions relating to the use of space-time processing in CDMA-based third-generation systems and have presented models for the integration of space-time processing, error correction coding, and multi-user detection techniques. Included is extensive background information on cellular systems, antenna array theory, smart antenna techniques, performance of basic space-time processors and advanced space-time processors. The book also includes an extensive simulation program written in Matlab®. The simulation code implements both the uplink and the downlink of a UMTS-like communication system. This provides multiple options for simulating system performance using a variety of channel models as well as receiver structures. Space-Time Processing for CDMA Mobile Communications will be an invaluable reference work for engineers and researchers, and a useful source for design engineers enabling them to understand the implications of adding space-time processing systems to CDMA-based communication systems.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">During 12-15 of September 1999, 10th International Symposium on P- sonal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC’99) was held in Osaka Japan, and it was really a successful symposium that accommodated more than 600 participants from more than 30 countries and regions. PIMRC is really well organized annual symposium for wireless multimedia commu- cation systems, in which, various up-to-date topics are discussed in the invited talk, panel discussions and tutorial sessions. One of the unique features of the PIMRC is that PIMRC is continuing to publish, from Kluwer Academic Publishers since 1997, a book that collects the hottest topics discussed in PIMRC. In PIMRC’97, Invited talks were sum- rized in “Wireless Communications –TDMA versus CDMA – (ISBN 0-7923- 8005-3),” and it was published just beforePIMRC’97. This book was also distributed to all the PIMRC’97 participants as a part of proceedings for the conference. In PIMRC’98, extendedversion of the invited papers were s- marized in Wireless Multimedia Network Technologies (ISBN 0-7923-8633- 7) and published in September 1999, which is almost the same timing for the PIMRC’99. In the case of PIMRC’99, to produce more informative book, we have - lected topics that attracted many PIMRC’99 participants during the conf- ence, and invited prospective authors not only from the invited speakers but also from tutorial speakers, panel organizers, panelists, and some other exc- lent PIMRC’99 participants.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">At present, the expansion of tetherless communications is a technological trend surpassed perhaps only by the explosive growth of the Internet. Wireless systems are being deployed today mainly for telephony, satisfying the ind- trialized nations’ appetite for talk-on-the-go, and providing much-needed communications infrastructure in developing countries. The desire for wi- less access to the Internet is starting to add fuel to the growth of tetherless communications. Indeed, the synergy of wireless and Internet technologies will lead to a host of exciting new applications, some of which are not yet envisioned. Future-generation wireless systems will achieve capacities much higher than the systems of today by incorporating myriad improvements. These in- vations include transmission in higher-frequency bands, “smart antennas”, multi-user detection, new forward error-correction techniques, and advanced network resource-allocation techniques. The term “smart antenna” usually refers to the deployment of multiple antennas at the base-station site, coupled with special processing of the m- tiple received signals. Smart antennas can adaptively reject co-channel int- ference and mitigate multipath fading, and have been identified by many as a promising means to extend base-station coverage, increase system capacity and enhance quality of service.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">With the increasing market penetration of cellular telephones, the number of E-911 calls placed by cellular telephones has grown cons- erably. This growth in E-911 calls led to a 1996 FCC ruling requiring that all cellular, PCS, and SMR licensees provide location information for the support of E-911 safety services. The provision of such location information is to be implemented in two phases. Phase I, whose deadline has already been passed, requires that wireless carriers relay the caller’s telephone number along with location of the cell site and/or sector se- ing the call, to a designated Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP). This information allows the PSAP to return the call if disconnected. Phase II, to be completed by October 1, 2001, is much more stringent and requires that the location of an E-911 caller be determined and reported with an rms location accuracy of 125 m in 67% of the cases. The applications of wireless location technology extend well beyond E-911 services. Location information can be used by cellular telephone operators themselves for more effective management of their radio - sources, so as to achieve greater spectral efficiencies. Resource m- agement algorithms such as hand-offs between cell sites, channel assi- ments, and others can all benefit from subscriber location information. Location information obtained from vehicular based cellular telephones can be used as an input to Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), and in particular traffic management and traveler information systems.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">This book is a collection of invited papers that were presented at the Ninth IEEE International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications, September 5-8, 1998, Boston, MA. These papers are meant to provide a global view of the emerging third-generation wireless networks in the wake of the third millennium. Following the tradition of the PIMRC conferences, the papers are selected to strike a balance between the diverse interests of academia and industry by addressing issues of interest to the designers, manufacturers, and service providers involved in the wireless networking industry. The tradition of publishing a collection of the invited papers presented at the PIMRC started in PIMRC’97, Helsinki, Finland. There are two benefits to this tradition (1) it provides a shorter version of the proceedings of the conference that is more focused on a specific theme (2) the papers are comprehensive and are subject of a more careful review process to improve the contents as well as the presentation of the material, making it more appealing for archival as a reference book. The production costs of the book is subsidized by the conference and the editors have donated the royalty income of the book to the conference.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">An important aspect of wireless networks is the deployment of their infrastructure. In this book, the Editors have invited a number of experts from industry to write on a variety of topics associated with deployment of digital wireless networks. The first part of the book consists of an overview of systems design and engineering integration, comparison of polarization and space diversity antenna systems, and the performance of deploying smart antenna architectures in cellular and PCS networks. The second part addresses deployment of CDMA networks, based on IS-95 standards. Here the authors discuss issues related to optimization of overlaid dual model CDMA networks, embedding microcells to improve hot-spot capacity, and mitigation of intermodulation distortion in handsets. Part III deals with deployment of TDMA- based networks. The issues presented include developing hierarchical systems, reconfigurable transceivers, and deploying the GSM frequency hopping feature for enhancing existing traffic capacity. The last part, on Wireless Data Networks, is comprised of issues related to the performance of GPRS systems deployed as an upgrade on current networks and deployment of wireless LANs. Critical issues for deploying an IEEE 802.11-based WLAN are examined. Wireless Network Deployments provides practical engineering guidance for wireless and cellular engineers, researchers, technicians, and managers working in second and third generation digital wireless networks.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Industrial gases are inextricably woven into the fabric of modern manufacturing. From the primary extraction of raw materials, through their intermediate processing to manufacture metals, chemicals and ceramics, to the fabrication of sophisticated industrial, consumer and food products, gases are used across the whole spectrum of industry. The isolation, manufature and supply of these gases is a major industry in itself; the 300 million tones of gas used each year generates sales in excess of $20 billion. In terms of tonnage, nitrogen has become the most used industrial gas, finding applications across the whole range of industry. It is still manufactured by liquifying and then distilling air, but as applications develop and demand increases, newer methods of isolation, such as pressure swing absorbtion and membrane seperation will become important. This new book introduces the main industrial gases and the gases industry, it discusses the main technologies for their isolation, seperation, manufacture and handling. In addition, the book contains an overview of the main applications of industrial gases and a brief discussion of new production processes and applications. Chemists, chemical engineers, physicists and technologists involved in the research and development, production or utilisation of industrial gases will find this concise book an essential and accessable reference source. For advanced students of these disciplines, the book provides a fascinating overview of this important industry.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">The initial plans for this book sprang from a late-afternoon conversation in a hotel bar. All three authors were attending the 1996 meeting of the Population As- ciation of America in New Orleans. While nursing drinks and expounding on a variety of topics, we began talking about our current research projects. It so happened that all three of us had been entertaining the notion of writing a book on state and local population projections. Recognizing the enormity of the project for a single author, we quickly decided to collaborate. Had we not decided to work together, it is unlikely that this book ever would have been written. The last comprehensive treatment of state and local population projections was Don Pittenger’s excellent work Projecting State and Local Populations (1976). Many changes affecting the production of population projections have occurred since that time. Technological changes have led to vast increases in computing power, new data sources, the development of GIS, and the creation of the Internet. The procedures for applying a number of projection methods have changed considerably, and several completely new methods have been developed.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Socially situated planning provides one mechanism for improving the social awareness ofagents. Obviously this work isin the preliminary stages and many of the limitation and the relationship to other work could not be addressed in such a short chapter. The chief limitation, of course, is the strong commitment to de?ning social reasoning solely atthe meta-level, which restricts the subtlety of social behavior. Nonetheless, our experience in some real-world military simulation applications suggest that the approach, even in its preliminary state, is adequate to model some social interactions, and certainly extends the sta- of-the art found in traditional training simulation systems.

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Advances In Digital Government presents a collection of in-depth articles that addresses a representative cross-section of the matrix of issues involved in implementing digital government systems. These articles constitute a survey of both the technical and policy dimensions related to the design, planning and deployment of digital government systems. The research and development projects within the technical dimension represent a wide range of governmental functions, including the provisioning of health and human services, management of energy information, multi-agency integration, and criminal justice applications. The technical issues dealt with in these projects include database and ontology integration, distributed architectures, scalability, and security and privacy. The human factors research emphasizes compliance with access standards for the disabled and the policy articles contain both conceptual models for developing digital government systems as well as real management experiences and results in deploying them. Advances In Digital Government presents digital government issues from the perspectives of different communities and societies. This geographic and social diversity illuminates a unique array of policy and social perspectives, exposing practitioners to new and useful ways of thinking about digital government.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">The purpose of this handbook, originally published in 1984, was to provide a compreh- sive review of current clinical descriptions, research , and theories of psychopathology. Descriptive psychopathology is a ?eld that forms the foundation of clinical practice and research in clinical psychology, psychiatry, psychiatric social work, psychiatric nursing, and allied professions in mental health. Since the 1st edition, the editors have devised and updated a handbook to cover both general and speci?c topics in psychopathology that would be useful to researchers, practitioners, and graduate or other advanced students in the mental health and behavioral medicine professions. To implement this plan, we have very carefully chosen colleagues whom we respect for their expertise in particular ?elds. These authors include both clinicians and researchers who have outstanding national reputations, as well as more junior behavioral scientists and clinicians who, in our opinion, will achieve similar recognition in the future. The excellent chapters in this book lead us to believe that we have chosen wisely. We would like to express our appreciation to these authors for their outstanding contributions and cooperation.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Metal-Oxygen Clusters is the first book, providing an overview of the surface chemistry and catalytic properties of heteropoly oxometalates. After a brief look at the early knowledge of heteropoly oxometalates, the book discusses the synthesis, characterization, structure, bulk properties and stability of these materials. The remainder and the largest portion of the book explores the properties of these solids as catalysts in acid-catalyzed and oxidation processes in supported or unsupported forms. The book provides an up-to-date review of the methods for synthesizing heteropoly oxometalates of Keggin structure, techniques from spectroscopic through electrochemical to elemental analysis for their characterization and the current information on their structure, bulk properties and their stabilities at high temperatures and under acid and alkaline conditions. The book discusses the materials employed as supports for the title solid and the results of the examination of the supported materials. Methods for the identification of the nature and source of the two catalytic functions, the acidic and oxidative properties, of the heteropoly oxometalates are reviewed and discussed. The use of both the supported and unsupported heteropoly oxometalates as catalysts in acidity-requisite processes ranging from methanol conversion to hydrocarbons to ring-expansion and contraction processes and in oxidation processes from methane cyclohexane are described and related to the aforementioned properties.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Justice—a word of great simplicity and almost frightening scope. When we were invited to edit a volume on justice in law, we joked about the small topic we had been assigned. Often humor masks fear, and this was certainly one of those times. Throughout the project, we found daunting the task of covering even a fraction of the topics that usually fall under the umbrella of justice research in law. Ultimately, the organization of the book emerged from the writing of it. Our introductory chapter provides a road map to how the topics weave together, but as is so often the case it was written last, not ?rst. It was only when we had chapters in hand that we began to see how the many strands of justice research might be woven together. Chapters 2–4 on the basic forms of justice—procedural, retributive, and distributive—are the lynchpin of the volume; they provide the building blocks that permit us to think and write about each of the other substantive and applied chapters in terms of how they relate to the fundamental forms of justice. In the large central section of the volume (Chapters 5–9), the contributors address many ways in which the justice dimensions relate to one another. Most important for law is the relationship of perceptions of procedural justice and the two types of substantive justice—retributive and distributive.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">The control of reactivity to achieve specific syntheses is one of the overarching goals of organic chemistry. In the decade since the publication of the third edition, major advances have been made in the development of efficient new methods, particularly catalytic processes, and in means for control of reaction stereochemistry. This volume assumes a level of familiarity with structural and mechanistic concepts comparable to that in the companion volume, Part A, Structures and Mechanisms. Together, the two volumes are intended to provide the advanced undergraduate or beginning graduate student in chemistry with a sufficient foundation to comprehend and use the research literature in organic chemistry. The New Revised 5th Edition will be available shortly. For details, click on the link in the right-hand column.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">DARE To Be You (DTBY) is a program that has both a conceptual foundation and is demonstrably effective in building assets linked to a decrease in problem behaviors. Its success is based on working not only with the individual child, but also with multiple systems that affect the child. These systems include family, peers, school and the broader community. The DTBY curricula is age-appropriate and adapted to account for changing developmental needs. While this volume focuses on the DTBY program for families with 2 to 5 year old children, references are made to the programs for school aged children and teens. This program has proven effective in diverse settings including a Native American community; an urban setting of mixed cultures; a traditional Hispanic and Anglo rural community; and a poor, isolated agricultural region.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Most of the literature in forensic mental health assessment is organized around the particular legal issue that is the focus of a given assessment, tool, or research study. This book starts with a different assumption: There are broad principles of forensic assessment that are applicable across different legal issues. If such principles exist, they should be derived from and supported by sources of authority in ethics, law, science, and prof- sional practice. This is what I seek to do in this book, with each of the 29 broad principles of forensic mental health assessment described and a- lyzed from the perspective of these sources of authority. There are a number of individuals who have contributed in various ways to making this a better book. It seems best to begin with a general acknowledgment: Those interested in forensic mental health assessment, particularly my colleagues from the American Psychology–Law Society and the American Board of Forensic Psychology, have been an extraor- narily helpful and congenial group. I have learned a great deal from them over the years and they challenged me to undertake the daunting task of trying to capture the broad views of the field in this book.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">The soil-transmitted nematode parasites, or geohelminths, are - called because they have a direct life cycle, which involves no intermediate hosts or vectors, and are transmitted by faecal contamination of soil, foodstuffs and water supplies. They all inhabit the intestine in their adult stages but most species also have tissue-migratoryjuvenile stages, so the disease manifestations they cause can therefore be both local and systemic. The geohelminths together present an enormous infection burden on humanity. Those which cause the most disease in humans are divided into three main groupings, Ascaris lumbricoides (the large roundworm), Trichuris trichiura (whipworm), and the blood-feeding hookworms (Ancylostoma duodenale and Necator americanus ), and this book concentrates on these. These intestinal parasites are highly prevalent worldwide, A. lumbricoides is estimated to infect 1471 million (over a quarter ofthe world’s population), hookworms 1277 million, and T. trichiura 1049 million. The highly pathogenic Strongyloides species might also be classified as geohelminths, but they are not dealt with here because the understanding of their epidemiology, immunology and genetics has not advanced as rapidly as for the others. This is primarily because of the often covert nature of the infections, with consequent difficulties for analysis. If there is ever a second edition of this book, then there will hopefully be much to say about this infection.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">In the late 1980s, it became painfully evident to the pharmaceutical industry that the old paradigm of drug discovery, which involved highly segmented drug - sign and development activities, would not produce an acceptable success rate in the future. Therefore, in the early 1990s a paradigm shift occurred in which drug design and development activities became more highly integrated. This new str- egy required medicinal chemists to design drug candidates with structural f- tures that optimized pharmacological (e. g. , high affinity and specificity for the target receptor), pharmaceutical (e. g. , solubility and chemical stability), bioph- maceutical (e. g. , cell membrane permeability), and metabolic/pharmacokinetic (e. g. , metabolic stability, clearance, and protein binding) properties. Successful implementation of this strategy requires a multidisciplinary team effort, incl- ing scientists from drug design (e. g. , medicinal chemists, cell biologists, en- mologists, pharmacologists) and drug development (e. g. , analytical chemists, pharmaceutical scientists, physiologists, and molecular biologists representing the disciplines of pharmaceutics, biopharmaceutics, and pharmacokinetics/drug metabolism). With this new, highly integrated approach to drug design now widely utilized by the pharmaceutical industry, the editors of this book have provided the sci- tific community with case histories to illustrate the nature of the interdisciplinary interactions necessary to successfully implement this new approach to drug d- covery. In the first chapter, Ralph Hirschmann provides a historical perspective of why this paradigm shift in drug discovery has occurred.</dcvalue>

The editors of this volume, the first in a two-volume series, are world renowned, having dedicated most of their lives to the study of great apes. The world's premiere primatologists, ethologists, and anthropologists present the most recent research on both captive and free-ranging African great apes. These scientists, through deep personal commitment and sacrifice, have expanded their knowledge of chimpanzees, bonobos, and gorillas. With forests disappearing, many of these studies will never be duplicated. This volume, and all in the Developments in Primatology book series, aim to broaden and deepen the understanding of this valuable cause.</dcvalue>

In contrast, this book looks at the ways in which the fear of death operates on a back burner throughout our lives and how it influences the choices we make and the paths that we follow in life. The author presents a `moral hierarchy' of behavior used in coping with the fear of death and dying.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Professor Philip G. Burke, CBE, FRS formally retired on 30 September 1998. To recognise this occasion some of his colleagues, friends, and former students decided to hold a conference in his honour and to present this volume as a dedication to his enormous contribution to the theoretical atomic physics community. The conference and this volume of the invited talks reflect very closely those areas with which he has mostly been asso- ated and his influence internationally on the development of atomic physics coupled with a parallel growth in supercomputing. Phil’s wide range of interests include electron-atom/molecule collisions, scattering of photons and electrons by molecules adsorbed on surfaces, collisions involving oriented and chiral molecules, and the development of non-perturbative methods for studying multiphoton processes. His devel- ment of the theory associated with such processes has enabled important advances to be made in our understanding of the associated physics, the interpretation of experimental data, has been invaluable in application to fusion processes, and the study of astrophysical plasmas (observed by both ground- and space-based telescopes). We therefore offer this volume as our token of affection and respect to Philip G. Burke, with the hope that it may also fill a gap in the literature in these important fields.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Proceedings of the 10th International Symposium on Trace Elements in Man and Animals (TEMA 10), held May 2-7, 1999, in Evian, France. This volume containing the proceedings of the tenth of the highly successful TEMA meetings, presents recent progress in the research on the functional role and metabolism of trace elements, and new developments in the understanding of molecular and cellular biology. Various contributions providing new data on zinc and copper transport mechanisms, enable a global view of the molecular metabolism of these metals in the human body, whilst other particularly dramatic results presented here offer new perspectives on the epidemiology of trace elements deficiency and supplementation. Also included are the results of recent major trials demonstrating the beneficial effect of selenium on human health. The spectacular growth of interest in the field of selenium, with the discovery of new selenoproteins and biological roles, is represented here along with the other areas of particular progress the research into boron and chromium, which have marked this year's meeting.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Anthropology, and by extension archaeology, has had a long-standing interest in evolution in one or several of its various guises. Pick up any lengthy treatise on humankind written in the last quarter of the nineteenth century and the chances are good that the word evolution will appear somewhere in the text. If for some reason the word itself is absent, the odds are excellent that at least the concept of change over time will have a central role in the discussion. After one of the preeminent (and often vilified) social scientists of the nineteenth century, Herbert Spencer, popularized the term in the 1850s, evolution became more or less a household word, usually being used synonymously with change, albeit change over extended periods of time. Later, through the writings of Edward Burnett Tylor, Lewis Henry Morgan, and others, the notion of evolution as it applies to stages of social and political development assumed a prominent position in anthropological disc- sions. To those with only a passing knowledge of American anthropology, it often appears that evolutionism in the early twentieth century went into a decline at the hands of Franz Boas and those of similar outlook, often termed particularists. However, it was not evolutionism that was under attack but rather comparativism— an approach that used the ethnographic present as a key to understanding how and why past peoples lived the way they did (Boas 1896).</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Behavioral assessment is a psychological assessment paradigm that emphasizes empirically supported, multimethod and multi-informant assessment of specific, observable behaviors and contemporaneous causal variables in the natural environment. The behavioral assessment paradigm stresses the use of well-validated assessment instruments and assumptions that social/environmental, cognitive, and physiological variables are often important sources of behavior variance. The behavioral assessment paradigm has had a major influence on the field of psychological assessment. It has affected the way research on the causes of behavior disorders is conducted, the way treatment processes and outcomes are evaluated, and the way treatment decisions are made. The goal of this book is to present the characteristics and underlying assumptions of the behavioral assessment paradigm and to show how they affect the strategies of behavioral assessment. Although all of the concepts and strategies discussed in this book are applicable in the research, this book focuses on the use of behavioral assessment to guide clinical judgements.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">The term `bioethics' was coined in 1971, just as interest in the medical humanities claimed a prominent place in medical education. Out of this interest, a substantial area of research and scholarship took shape: the philosophy of medicine. This field has been directed to the epistemological, ontological, and value-theoretical issues occasioned by medicine and the biomedical sciences. Bioethics is nested in this field and can only be fully understood in terms of the foundational issues it addresses. This collection of essays in honor of Stuart F. Spicker, one of the individuals who gave shape to the philosophy of medicine, lays out the broad scope of concerns from the philosophy of embodiment, to issues of the role of ethics consultants, to concepts of disease, equity and the meaning of history.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">A recent technological advance is the art of designing circuits to test themselves, referred to as a Built-In Self-Test (BIST). This idea was first proposed around 1980 and has grown to become one of the most important testing techniques at the current time, as well as for the future. This book is written from a designer's perspective and describes the major BIST approaches that have been proposed and implemented since 1980, along with their advantages and limitations. The BIST approaches include the Built-In Logic Block Observer, pseudo-exhaustive BIST techniques, Circular BIST, scan-based BIST, BIST for regular structures, BIST for FPGAs and CPLDs, mixed-signal BIST, and the integration of BIST with concurrent fault detection techniques for on-line testing. Particular attention is paid to system-level use of BIST in order to maximize the benefits of BIST through reduced testing time and cost as well as high diagnostic resolution. The author spent 15 years as a designer at Bell Labs where he designed over 20 production VLSI devices and 3 production circuit boards. Sixteen of the VLSI devices contained BIST of various types for regular structures and general sequential logic, including the first BIST for Random Access Memories (RAMs), the first completely self-testing integrated circuit, and the first BIST for mixed-signal systems at Bell Labs. He has spent the past 10 years in academia where his research and development continues to focus on BIST, including the first BIST for FPGAs and CPLDs along with continued work in the area of BIST for general sequential logic and mixed-signal systems. He holds 10 US patents (with 5 more pending) for various types of BIST approaches. Therefore, the author brings a unique blend of knowledge and experience to this practical guide for designers, test engineers, product engineers, system diagnosticians, and managers.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Neurology has always been a discipline in which careful physical examination is paramount. The rich vocabulary of neurology replete with eponyms attests to this historically. The decline in the importance of the examination has long been predicted with the advent of more detailed neuroimaging. However, neuroimaging has often provided a surfeit of information from which salient features have to be identified, dependent upon the neurological examination. A dictionary of neurological signs has a secure future. A dictionary should be informative but unless it is unwieldy, it cannot be comprehensive, nor is that claimed here. Andrew Larner has decided sensibly to include key features of the history as well as the examination. There is no doubt that some features of the history can strike one with the force of a physical sign. There are entries for “palinopsia” and “environmental tilt” both of which can only be elicited from the history and yet which have considerable significance. There is also an entry for the “head turning sign” observed during the history taking itself as well as the majority of entries relating to details of the physical examination. This book is directed to students and will be valuable to medical students, trainee neurologists, and professions allied to medicine. Neurologists often speak in shorthand and so entries such as “absence” and “freezing” are sensible and helpful.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Since the publication of the first edition of this book in 1983, A Handbook for Medical Teachers has established itself as an ideal resource for new and established teachers who frequently still have little opportunities for education training. Its popularity relates to the successful combination of sound educational principles, a how-to-do-it approach and an entertaining easy-to-read style. It is supported by numerous illustrations, examples, and pertinent cartoons. This fourth edition has been extensively revised to reflect the major changes that continue to occur in both undergraduate and postgraduate education. Many academic staff are coming under external and internal review to demonstrate their teaching competence and the quality of their courses and assessments. This book gives valuable help and advice to those having to respond to such pressures.

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Algorithms for VLSI Physical Design Automation, Third Edition covers all aspects of physical design. The book is a core reference for graduate students and CAD professionals. For students, concepts and algorithms are presented in an intuitive manner. For CAD professionals, the material presents a balance of theory and practice. An extensive bibliography is provided which is useful for finding advanced material on a topic. At the end of each chapter, exercises are provided, which range in complexity from simple to research level. Algorithms for VLSI Physical Design Automation, Third Edition provides a comprehensive background in the principles and algorithms of VLSI physical design. The goal of this book is to serve as a basis for the development of introductory-level graduate courses in VLSI physical design automation. It provides self-contained material for teaching and learning algorithms of physical design. All algorithms which are considered basic have been included, and are presented in an intuitive manner. Yet, at the same time, enough detail is provided so that readers can actually implement the algorithms given in the text and use them. The first three chapters provide the background material, while the focus of each chapter of the rest of the book is on each phase of the physical design cycle. In addition, newer topics such as physical design automation of FPGAs and MCMs have been included. The basic purpose of the third edition is to investigate the new challenges presented by interconnect and process innovations. In 1995 when the second edition of this book was prepared, a six-layer process and 15 million transistor microprocessors were in advanced stages of design. In 1998, six metal process and 20 million transistor designs are in production. Two new chapters have been added and new material has been included in almost allother chapters. A new chapter on process innovation and its impact on physical design has been added. Another focus of the third edition is to promote use of the Internet as a resource, so wherever possible URLs have been provided for further investigation. Algorithms for VLSI Physical Design Automation, Third Edition is an important core reference work for professionals as well as an advanced level textbook for students.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Over the past 20 years aqueous organometallic catalysis has found applications in small- scale organic synthesis in the laboratory, as well as in the industrial production of chemicals with a combined output close to one million tons per year. Aqueous/organic two-phase reactions allow easy product-catalyst separation and full catalyst recovery which mean clear benefits not only in economic but also in environmental and green chemistry contexts. Instead of putting together a series of expert reviews of specialized fields, this book attempts to give a comprehensive yet comprehensible description of the various catalytic transformations in aqueous systems as seen by an author who has been working on aqueous organometallic catalysis since its origin. Emphasis is put on the discussion of differences between related non-aqueous and aqueous processes due to the presence of water. The book will be of interest to experts and students working in catalysis, inorganic chemistry or organic synthesis, and may serve as a basis for advanced courses.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Advocates for the arts have contributed significantly to the philosophy and practice of early and elementary education throughout its history. Yet the nature, value, and purpose of arts experiences in the lives of children seem to remain puzzling and problematic to those most directly involved in teaching the young. Conversations between scholars and teacher educators in the arts and in education occur all too infrequently. Seventeen authors, whose work represents the best of contemporary research and theory on a constellation of issues concerning the role of the arts in children's lives and learning, address critical issues of development, context, and curriculum from perspectives informed by work with children in formal and informal settings. This anthology strives to reinvigorate dialogue on the role and significance of the arts in the education of children drawing on various cultural and institutional context and traditional and contemporary practices from different parts of the world.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Over the past two decades, the assessment of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (AD/HD) has evolved into a sophisticated balance of science and clinical judgement essential for arriving at reliable and valid diagnostic de- sions. Because of the precarious mix of clinical and empirical skill needed to evaluate children with this disorder, diagnostic practice in this area has been found wanting by many critics. In fact, a 1998 National Institutes of Health consensus panel concluded that “existing diagnostic treatment practices … point to the need for improved awareness by the health service sector conce- ing an appropriate assessment, treatment, and follow-up. A more consistent set of diagnostic procedures and practice guidelines is of utmost importance” (p. 21). Drs. Arthur D. Anastopoulos and Terri L. Shelton have designed a book that addresses this need. A number of themes are highlighted throughout the text. Perhaps the most important is that the assessment guidelines set forth in this book represent a balance between science and practice. The authors account for the realities of clinical practice in an age of managed care while challenging clinicians to heed the lessons of empirical research. Although the use of empirically based asse- ment procedures may at times fly in the face of cost constraints (e. g. , systematic evaluation of medication effects), the authors present a strong argument for them. Further, they call upon their vast clinical experience to provide concrete suggestions for translating research findings into effective evaluations.</dcvalue>

We discuss cutting-edge surveys that are being adopted by all countries in the European community as a standardized measure of each country's progress. We also discuss how developing countries can begin the measurement of Quality of Life in ways that will increase political credibility and require smaller budgets. Other chapters describe policy applications of the Quality of Life surveys, including nations' health goals, smoking cessation, child welfare, and poverty reduction. The authors of these chapters are the world's top experts on assessing Quality of Life. For example, the author of the first chapter is Sten Johansson, former Director of Statistics Sweden, responsible for creating the first comprehensive QOL assessment systems in the world, beginning in the 1960's. The author of the second chapter is Professor Ruut Veenhoven, known as the premier researcher on national happiness, having developed the largest database in the world on the subjective measures of well-being. Heinz-Herbert Noll is responsible for developing the unified Quality of Life measurement system for the new European Union, where up to 25 countries will be assessed using the same methodology and questionnaires.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">In 1974 when I published my book, Biological Mechanism of Attachment, not many pages were required to report on the attachment devices of insect cuticles. As in most fields of research, our knowledge on this specific subject has simply exploded. Dr. Stanislav N. Gorb now describes the present day level of our knowledge, to which he has personally contributed so much, and a research team working on biological microtribology has gradually developed, also. With modern methods of measurement it is possible to enter the structure – function relationship much more deeply, even down to a molecular level, which was not possible two and a half decades ago. It is a well known fact that, in biology, the more sophisticated the measuring method, the greater the achievement of biological fundamental research, and its resulting evidence. Our knowledge remains at a certain level until new methods once more permit a forward leap. Biological knowledge develops in the form of a stepped curve rather than linear, as reflected in the studies carried out on the attachment devices of insect cuticles.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">In recent years, there has been considerable interest in highly integrated, low power, portable wireless devices. There are three primary areas to be addressed when higher performance and lower power is desired. The first area is the device technology. Scaling of devices has realized steady improvements for many years. The second area is improved circuit design techniques. The final area is at the architectural level. This monograph focuses on the problem of low power GFSK/GMSK modulation and presents an architectural approach for improved performance. The new architecture is a modulated S-D fractional-N frequency synthesizer. The key innovation is an automatic calibration technique, which operates in the background. The availability of the calibration circuit makes high data rate, low power modulation possible. From the Foreword: "The key contribution of the work presented in this monograph is a technique for in service automatic calibration of the modulated frequency synthesizer by ensuring that the digital emphasis filter and analog loop filter characteristics are matched. The automatic calibration circuit operates while the transmitter is in service and compensates for process and temperature variation. GFSK and 4-GFSK modulation was demonstrated at data rates of 2.5 Mb/s and 5 Mb/s respectively at an RF output carrier frequency of 1.8 GHz. ... In addition, he presents some valuable tools for the practicing engineer in this field." by Charles G. Sodini</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Design reuse techniques have become the subject of books, conferences, and podium discussions over the last few years. However, most discussions focus on higher-level abstraction like RTL descriptions, which can be synthesized. Design reuse is often seen as an add-on to normal design activity, or a special design task that is not an integrated part of the existing design flow. This may all be true for the ASIC world, but not for high-speed, high-performance microprocessors. In the field of high-speed microprocessors, design reuse is an integrated part of the design flow. The method of choice in this demanding field was, and is always, physical design reuse at the layout level. In the past, the practical implementations of this method were linear shrinks and the lambda approach. With the scaling of process technology down to 0.18 micron and below, this approach lost steam and became inefficient. The only viable solution is a method, which is now called Automatic Layout Modification (ALM). It combines compaction, mask manipulation, and correction with powerful capabilities. Automatic Layout Modification, Including design reuse of the Alpha CPU in 0.13 micron SOI technology is a welcome effort to improving some of the practices in chip design today.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Our contemporary division of the progress of time should be delineated as B. A. E. (Before the AIDS Epidemic, i. e. , 1981) and P. A. E. Everyone keeps predicting the end of the epidemic, as Newsweek did in 1996 when combination therapy was introduced. But as far as we can tell from this vantage point, the virus continues, albeit a bit hobbled by a few drugs here and there, but moving forward nonetheless. Predictions are that over 100 million people will be infected with HIV by 2005. It is also clear that the number of people living with HIV in the US and other developed countries will continue to grow, as people with HIV live longer and better lives, but, paradoxically and perhaps as a result, the number of people acquiring HIV also continues to grow. HIV vaccines are at least 20, and perhaps 40 years away. When they do come on board, they may not prevent infection but may, instead, change the course of illness in those infected and hopefully render them less infectious. Further, the first vaccines will, in all likelihood, be less than 100% effective. The next generation of prevention strategies need to combine the best of biomedical, social, and behavioral approaches in order to protect the population. The male condom, along with reduction in the number of sexual partners or outright abstinence, have been the mainstay of HIV prevention.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Bioenergy from Sustainable Forestry synthesizes information needed to design or implement sustainable forest management systems for production of biomass for energy in conjunction with other forest products. It is organized around the criteria for sustainable forest management: productivity, environment, social issues, economics, and legal and institutional framework. More than 25 international experts from 10 countries have brought together available ecological, physical, operational, social and economic information and identified gaps in knowledge related to biomass production and harvesting systems. This is the first time that such comprehensive information has been brought together under one cover, using an integrated, holistic approach. Guiding principles and state of the art knowledge are emphasized. The book will enable forest resource managers and planners to evaluate the ability of specific forest regions to sustainably meet bioenergy production demands.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Biophysics, being an interdisciplinary topic, is of great importance in modern biology. This book addresses the needs of biologists, biochemists, and medical biophysicists for an introduction to the subject. The text is based on a one-semester course offered to graduate students of life sciences, and covers a wide range of topics from quantum mechanics to pre-biotic evolution. To understand the topics, only basic school level mathematics is required. The first chapter introduces and refreshes the reader's knowledge of physics and chemistry. The next chapters cover various physico-chemical techniques used to study biomolecular structures, followed by treatments of spectroscopy, microscopy, diffraction, and computational techniques. X-ray crystallography and NMR are dealt with in greater detail. The latter half of the book covers results obtained from applications of the above techniques. Some of the other topics dealt with are energy pathways, biomechanics, and neuro-biophysics.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">This Cancer Prevention book series aims to complement the research reported in the journal Cancer Causes and Control. Volumes in this series will summarize the state of the science from causes to prevention of cancer. The scope will be international. The past 20 years has seen an explosion of epidemiologic material on the causes of cancer. Examples include the growing number of studies of physical activity and colon cancer which have emerged and the numerous studies of components of diet such as alcohol and the risk of specific cancers. Major shifts in resource allocation now focus on translation of this new knowledge to actual cancer prevention programs. Researchers, practicing clinicians, and those who write and implement public health policy need this information summarized in an easily accessible format. The abundance of knowledge, increasing understanding of how to communicate risk of cancer to the public, and greater public awareness of cancer, make the coming years ones in which we will see many new attempts at widespread cancer prevention programs. For example, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention launched a national colon cancer awareness campaign in early 1999.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Epidemiology has often been defined as the study of the distribution of disease, together with the distribution of factors that may modify that risk of disease. As such, epidemiology has often been reduced to a methodology only, providing a mechanism for the study of disease that is somehow removed, separate and apart from the populations that serve as its focus. Epidemiology, however, is much more than that. The discipline p- vides a way of perceiving and knowing the world, and of relating to the c- munities whose health and disease patterns we are trying to understand. As such, its usefulness extends past the construction of questionnaires, the detective work inherent in tracing the source of an infection or the analysis of data. Rather, epidemiology serves as a point of reference and a linkage between various domains of reality: in the courtroom, between a com- nity’s injuries and those alleged to be responsible for those violations; between the community striving to effectuate changes to improve its health and environment and the lawmakers and policymakers whose actions may dictate or control the likelihood of that change; and between “mainstream” populations and those who become or remain marginalized and stigmatized due to disease or perceived disease.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">The analysis and modification of glycans of recombinant proteins continues to be active and challenging area of research and for the successful manufacture of these proteins. In Cell Engineering, volume 3: Glycosylation, Dr. Mohammed Al-Rubeai has compiled a group of articles that will provide research workers not only with reviews of the advances that have been made in all facets of the subject but with an in-depth assessment of the state of the art methodology and the various approaches for the improvement of glycoprotein production. Particularly important in this respect is the advances made in the development of genetically engineered host cell lines with novel glycosylation properties, as well as the integration of mass spectrophotometric analysis with separation techniques. This volume is intended not only for research students and senior scientists in cell culture and glycobiology, but also for industrial biotechnologists and biochemical engineers interested in the production of therapeutic glycoproteins, virus vector and ex vivo expansion of human cells for medical treatment.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Chapters in Game Theory has been written on the occasion of the 65th birthday of Stef Tijs, who can be regarded as the godfather of game theory in the Netherlands. The contributors all are indebted to Stef Tijs, as former Ph.D. students or otherwise. The book contains fourteen chapters on a wide range of subjects. Some of these can be considered surveys while other chapters present new results: most contributions can be positioned somewhere in between these categories. The topics covered include: cooperative stochastic games; noncooperative stochastic games; sequencing games; games arising form linear (semi-) infinite programming problems; network formation, costs and potential games; potentials and consistency in transferable utility games; the nucleolus and equilibrium prices; population uncertainty and equilibrium selection; cost sharing; centrality in social networks; extreme points of the core; equilibrium sets of bimatrix games; game theory and the market; and transfer procedures for nontransferable utility games. Both editors did their Ph.D with Stef Tijs, while he was affiliated with the mathematics department of the University of Nijmegen.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">CMOS Circuit Design for RF Sensors is about CMOS circuit design for sensor and actuators to be used in wireless RF systems. The main application is implantable transducers for biomedical purposes such as sensing of nerve signals and electrical stimulation of nerves. Special focus is put on the power and data link in a wireless system with transducers which are powered via the RF link. Novel principles and methods are presented for the regulation of power to the sensors and for the distribution of data and power in an implanted transducer system. One of the main problems in such systems is the transmission of power via an RF link. This problem is analyzed in detail and solutions incorporating an RF magnetic link to the transducers are identified. The theoretical results are supported by experiments from CMOS chips including a system chip for functional electrical stimulation (FES).</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">CMOS Logic Circuit Design is an up-to-date treatment of the analysis and design of CMOS integrated digital logic circuits. It is a self- contained treatment that covers all of the important digital circuit design styles found in modern CMOS chips. Introductory chapters on MOSFET physics and CMOS fabrication provide the background needed for a solid understanding of the circuit design techniques in the remainder of the book. Static CMOS logic design is given an in-depth treatment which covers both the analysis and design of these types of circuits. Emphasis is on analyzing circuits to understand the relationship between the design and performance in an integrated environment. Analytic models and their application are presented to provide a uniform base for the design philosophy developed in the study. Dynamic circuit concepts such as charge sharing and charge leakage are presented in detail and then applied to dynamic logic families such as domino cascades, self-resetting logic, and dynamic single-phase designs. Differential logic families are given an entire chapter that discusses CVSL, CPL, and related design styles. Chip issues such as interconnect modeling, crosstalk, and input/output circuits round out the coverage. CMOS Logic Circuit Design provides the reader with an opportunity to see the field in a unified manner that emphasizes solving design problems using the various logic styles available in CMOS. CMOS Logic Circuit Design is designed to be used as both a textbook (either in the classroom or for self-study) and as a reference for the VLSI chip designer.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Modern computer technology has opened up several new possibilities for optimizing the administration of educational and psychological tests. In computer adaptive testing (CAT), tests are automatically tailored to the proficiency level of the individual examinees. Currently, nearly all large-scale testing programs in the western world are already adaptive or in the process of becoming so. Written by active CAT researchers from Europe and North America, the chapters offer a comprehensive introduction to the latest developments in the theory and practice of CAT. The book can be used both as a basic reference on the state of the art in CAT and a valuable resource in graduate courses on test theory. The theoretical chapters in this book cover such topics as item selection and ability estimation, item pool development and maintenance, item calibration and model fit, and testlet-based adaptive testing. The practical chapters describe the operational aspects of existing large-scale CAT programs.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">ConieD is the biannual Congress on Computers in Education, organised by the Spanish Association for the Development of Computers in Education (ADIE). The last Congress, held in Puertollano (Ciudad Real), brought together researchers in different areas, ranging from web applications, educational environments, or Human-Computer Interaction to Artificial Intelligence in Education. The common leitmotiv of the major part of the lectures was the World Wide Web. In particular, the focus was on the real possibilities that this media presents in order to make the access of students to educational resources possible anywhere and anytime. This fact was highlighted in the Conclusions of the Congress following this Preface as the Introduction. From the full 92 papers presented to the Programme Committee we have selected the best 24 papers that we are presenting in this book. The selection of papers was a very difficult process, taking into account that the papers presented in the Congress (60) were all good enough to appear in this book. Only the restrictions of the extension of this book have limited the number of papers to 24. These papers represent the current high-quality contributions of Spanish research groups in Computers in Education. Manuel Ortega Cantero José Bravo Rodríguez Editors xiii Introduction ConieD’99 (1st National Congress on Computers in Education) has brought together a very important group of Spanish and Latin American researchers devoted to studying the application and use of computers in education.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">In 1968 when I forsook horticulture and plant physiology to try, with the help of Sea Grant funds, wetland ecology, it didn’t take long to discover a slim volume published in 1959 by the University of Georgia and edited by R. A. Ragotzkie, L. R. Pomeroy, J. M. Teal, and D. C. Scott, entitled “Proceedings of the Salt Marsh Conference” held in 1958 at the Marine Institute, Sapelo Island, Ga. Now forty years later, the Sapelo Island conference has been the major intellectual impetus, and another Sea Grant Program the major backer, of another symposium, the “International Symposium: Concepts and Controversies in Tidal Marsh Ecology”. This one re-examines the ideas of that first conference, ideas that stimulated four decades of research and led to major legislation in the United States to conserve coastal wetlands. It is dedicated, appropriately, to two then young scientists – Eugene P. Odum and John M. Teal – whose inspiration has been the starting place for a generation of coastal wetland and estuarine research. I do not mean to suggest that wetland research started at Sapelo Island. In 1899 H. C. Cowles described successional processes in Lake Michigan freshwater marsh ponds. There is a large and valuable early literature about northern bogs, most of it from Europe and the former USSR, although Eville Gorham and R. L. Lindeman made significant contributions to the American literature before 1960. V. J.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Constructing test items for standardized tests of achievement, ability, and aptitude is a task of enormous importance. The interpretability of a test's scores flows directly from the quality of its items and exercises. Concomitant with score interpretability is the notion that including only carefully crafted items on a test is the primary method by which the skilled test developer reduces unwanted error variance, or errors of measurement, and thereby increases a test score's reliability. The aim of this entire book is to increase the test constructor's awareness of this source of measurement error, and then to describe methods for identifying and minimizing it during item construction and later review. Persons involved in assessment are keenly aware of the increased attention given to alternative formats for test items in recent years. Yet, in many writers' zeal to be `curriculum-relevant' or `authentic' or `realistic', the items are often developed seemingly without conscious thought to the interpretations that may be garnered from them. This book argues that the format for such alternative items and exercises also requires rigor in their construction and even offers some solutions, as one chapter is devoted to these alternative formats. This book addresses major issues in constructing test items by focusing on four ideas. First, it describes the characteristics and functions of test items. A second feature of this book is the presentation of editorial guidelines for writing test items in all of the commonly used item formats, including constructed-response formats and performance tests. A third aspect of this book is the presentation of methods for determining the quality of test items. Finally, this book presents a compendium of important issues about test items, including procedures for ordering items in a test, ethical and legal concerns over using copyrighted test items, item scoring schemes, computer-generated items and more.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">A cooperative system is defined to be multiple dynamic entities that share information or tasks to accomplish a common, though perhaps not singular, objective. Examples of cooperative control systems might include: robots operating within a manufacturing cell, unmanned aircraft in search and rescue operations or military surveillance and attack missions, arrays of micro satellites that form a distributed large aperture radar, employees operating within an organization, and software agents. The term entity is most often associated with vehicles capable of physical motion such as robots, automobiles, ships, and aircraft, but the definition extends to any entity concept that exhibits a time dependent behavior. Critical to cooperation is communication, which may be accomplished through active message passing or by passive observation. It is assumed that cooperation is being used to accomplish some common purpose that is greater than the purpose of each individual, but we recognize that the individual may have other objectives as well, perhaps due to being a member of other caucuses. This implies that cooperation may assume hierarchical forms as well. The decision-making processes (control) are typically thought to be distributed or decentralized to some degree. For if not, a cooperative system could always be modeled as a single entity. The level of cooperation may be indicated by the amount of information exchanged between entities. Cooperative systems may involve task sharing and can consist of heterogeneous entities. Mixed initiative systems are particularly interesting heterogeneous systems since they are composed of humans and machines. Finally, one is often interested in how cooperative systems perform under noisy or adversary conditions. In December 2000, the Air Force Research Laboratory and the University of Florida successfully hosted the first Workshop on Cooperative Control and Optimization in Gainesville, Florida. This book contains selected refereed papers summarizing the participants' research in control and optimization of cooperative systems. Audience: Faculty, graduate students, and researchers in optimization and control, computer sciences and engineering.</dcvalue>

Based on a large number of publications and studies, the opinions of researchers are grouped into three categories: those that believe in a convergence into the direction of the market-oriented model (with the Anglo-American model as the reference base), those that opt for another type of convergence, namely in the direction of a hybrid corporate governance model (based on cross-reference between different leading governance models), and those that do not believe in global convergence but adhere to diversity of governance models.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">The game-theoretic modelling of negotiations has been an active research area for the past five decades, that started with the seminal work by Nobel laureate John Nash in the early 1950s. This book provides a survey of some of the major developments in the field of strategic bargaining models with an emphasize on the role of threats in the negotiation process. Threats are all actions outside the negotiation room that negotiators have ate their disposal and the use of these actions affect the bargaining position of all negotiators. Of course, each negotiator aims to strengthen his own position. Examples of threats are the announcement of a strike by a union in centralized wage bargaining, or a nation’s announcement of a trade war directed against other nations in negotiations for trade liberalization. This book is organized on the basis of a simple guiding principle: The situation in which none of the parties involved in the negotiations has threats at its disposal is the natural benchmark for negotiations where the parties can make threats. Also on the technical level, negotiations with variable threats build on and extend the techniques applied in analyzing bargaining situations without threats. The first part of this book, containing chapter 3-6, presents the no-threat case, and the second part, containing chapter 7-10, extends the analysis for negotiation situations where threats are present. A consistent and unifying framework is provided first in 2.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Teachers make a difference. As someone who grew up in one of the po- est and rural areas of a poor state and ended up attending elite graduate and professional schools, I have much to credit my public school teachers. My teachers sure struggled much to teach an amazingly wide variety of students from different backgrounds, abilities, and hopes. Given that re- ity, which undoubtedly repeats itself across the United States and globe, one would think that I should be quite hesitant to criticize a system that produces countless grateful students and productive citizens. I agree. The pages that follow surely can be perceived as yet another attack on already much maligned schools that do produce impressive outcomes despite their limited resources, increased obligations, and the sustained barrage of attacks from competing interest groups. Some may even view the text as an affront to the inalienable rights of parents to raise their children as they see fit. Others surely could understand the analysis as another assault on our decentralized legal and school systems that should retain the right to balance the needs of communities, parents, schools, and students. I clearly did not intend, and do not see the ultimate result, as yet another diatribe on the manner teachers, parents and communities treat students.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">In a relatively short period of time Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) has grown into a powerful quantitative, analytical tool for measuring and evaluating performance. It has been successfully applied to a host of different entities engaged in a wide variety of activities in many contexts worldwide. In many cases evaluations of these entities have been resistant to other approaches because complex, multiple levels of (often) poorly understood relations must be considered. A few examples of these multifaceted problems are (1) maintenance activities of US Air Force bases in geographically dispersed locations, (2) police force efficiencies in the United Kingdom, (3) branch bank performances in Canada, Cyprus, and other countries and (4) the efficiency of universities in performing their education and research functions in the U.S., England, and France. In addition to localized problems, DEA applications have been extended to performance evaluations of `larger entities' such as cities, regions, and countries. These extensions have a wider scope than traditional analyses because they include `social' and `safety-net' expenditures as inputs and various `quality-of-life' dimensions as outputs. In other applications, DEA has been used to supply new insights into business activities and into the methods that have been used to evaluate these activities. These include `benchmarking' studies of professional organizations including legal and accounting societies, as well as organizational forms--such as evaluating the relative efficiencies of the `mutual' vs. `corporate' forms of organization that are used in the U.S. insurance industry. Finally, DEA can also be used to evaluate objects as well as governmental, business and societal activities. For example, a test study found that DEA compared favorably with traditional engineering approaches for use in evaluating the relative efficiencies of jet aircraft engines. These advantages accrued to DEA because of its ability to simultaneously handle multiple outputs and inputs without having to first specify a system of weights for use in effecting these evaluations. Data Envelopment Analysis: A Comprehensive Text with Models, Applications, References, and DEA-Solver Software is designed to provide a systematic introduction to DEA and its uses as a multifaceted tool for evaluating problems in a variety of contexts. Each chapter accompanies its developments with simple numerical examples and discussions of actual applications. Emphasis is placed on the use as well as an understanding of DEA and the topics in this book have been selected and treated accordingly. The objective is to introduce students, researchers, and practitioners in business, economics, engineering, and the sciences to Data Envelopment Analysis. The authors have been involved in DEA's development from the beginning. William Cooper (with Abraham Charnes and Edwardo Rhodes) is a founder of DEA. Lawrence Seiford and Kaoru Tone have been actively involved as researchers and practitioners from its earliest beginnings. All have been deeply involved in uses of DEA in practical applications as well as in the development of its basic theory and methodologies. The result is a textbook grounded in authority, experience and substance.

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">In recent years, much work has been done in formulating and clarifying the concept of sustainable development and related theoretical and research issues. Now, the challenge has shifted to designing and stimulating processes of effective planning and decision-making, at all levels of human activity, in such a way as to achieve local and global sustainable development. Information technology can help a great deal in achieving sustainable development by providing well-designed and useful tools for decision makers. One such tool is the decision support system, or DSS. This book explores the area of DSS in the context of sustainable development. As DSS is a very new technique, especially in the developing world, this book will serve as a reference text, primarily for managers, government officials, and information professionals in developing countries. It covers the concept of sustainable development, defines DSS and how it can be used in the planning and management of sustainable development, and examines the state of the art in DSS use. Other interested readers will include students, teachers, and analysts in information sciences; DSS designers, developers, and implementors; and international development agencies.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">This book is a systematic guide to the recognition and interpretation of deformation microstructures and mechanisms in minerals and rocks at the scale of a thin section. Diagnostic features of microstructures and mechanisms are emphasized, and the subject is extensively illustrated with high-quality color and black and white photomicrographs, and many clear diagrams. After introducing three main classes of deformation microstructures and mechanisms, low- to high-grade deformation is presented in a logical sequence in Chapters 2 to 5. Magmatic/submagmatic deformation, shear sense indicators, and shock microstructures and metamorphism are described in Chapters 6 to 8, which are innovative chapters in a structural geology textbook. The final chapter shows how deformation microstructures and mechanisms can be used quantitatively to understand the behavior of the earth. Recent experimental research on failure criteria, frictional sliding laws, and flow laws is summarized in tables, and palaeopiezometry is discussed. Audience: This book is essential to all practising structural and tectonic geologists who use thin sections, and is an invaluable research tool for advanced undergraduates, postgraduates, lecturers and researchers in structural geology and tectonics.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Design for AT-Speed Test, Diagnosis and Measurement is the first book to offer practical and proven design-for-testability (DFT) solutions to chip and system design engineers, test engineers and product managers at the silicon level as well as at the board and systems levels. Designers will see how the implementation of embedded test enables simplification of silicon debug and system bring-up. Test engineers will determine how embedded test provides a superior level of at-speed test, diagnosis and measurement without exceeding the capabilities of their equipment. Product managers will learn how the time, resources and costs associated with test development, manufacture cost and lifecycle maintenance of their products can be significantly reduced by designing embedded test in the product. A complete design flow and analysis of the impact of embedded test on a design makes this book a `must read' before any DFT is attempted.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">This book is based on my doctoral thesis at the Helsinki University of Technology. Several different projects during five years guided me from the basics of the RF IC design to the implementations of highly integrated radio receiver chips. Sharing time and effort between IC and system issues is not always straightforward. I have been lucky to follow both topics and share experiences with diligent and enthusiastic people having different specialities. As a result, this book will cover a wide range of different topics needed in the design of highly integrated radio receivers. Experiences from the first receiver prototypes for the third generation cellular systems form the basis of this book. Most of the issues are directly related to the early proposals of European and Japanese standardization organizations. For example, the chip rate was originally set to 4. 096 Mcps in a wide-band CDMA channel. I have kept that number in the book in most of the examples although it has been later changed to 3. 84 Mcps. I hope that the readers will accept that and the possible other incompabilities to the latest specifications. At least in the research phase the changes even in the most essential requirements are definitely not a rare incident and IC designers should be able to react and modify their designs as soon as they can.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Doppler Applications in LEO Satellite Communication Systems develops and presents an important class of techniques useful in the construction of little Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite communication systems. It centers on the very significant Doppler shift that attends communications through a LEO satellite and shows how this phenomenon can be exploited for an unexpected benefit. The techniques taught in the book are expected to be particularly attractive to system engineers because ground-based transceivers must generally compensate for the large Doppler component and therefore the necessary receiver processing loops are often already in place and expensed. This volume starts with a recounting of the characteristics of a LEO satellite and its orbit. The 2nd chapter addresses the LEO orbital geometry and reviews the Doppler effect attending LEO communications. Chapter three is focused on the important task of estimating the Doppler at a ground terminal. Appropriate signal processing algorithms are reviewed. Chapter four is concerned with predicting LEO satellite visibility. Chapters five and six are, respectively, devoted to the use of the significant LEO Doppler as an aid in a new traffic flow control protocol and as an aid for effecting communications power control. The last chapter describes MATLAB® based analysis. Doppler Applications in LEO Satellite Communication Systems provides a thorough review of the LEO Doppler phenomenon.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Recent droughts in Africa and elsewhere in the world, from China to Peru, have serious implications for food security and grave consequences for local and international politics. The issues do not just concern the plight of African peoples, but also our global ecological future. Global climatic changes become manifest initially in regions that are marginal or unstable. Africa's Sahel zone is one of the most sensitive climatic regions in the world and the events that have gripped that region beginning in the 1970's were the first indicator of a significant shift in global climatic conditions. This work aims to bring archaeology with the domain on contemporary human affairs and to forge a new methodology for coping with environmental problems from an archaeological perspective. Using the later prehistory of Africa as a comparison, the utility of this methodological strategy in interpreting culture change and assessing long-term response to current, global climatic fluctuations is examined and understood.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">In the policy arena, as well as in the academic world, a new challenge is having to deal with the global community. We are increasingly aware that the world is linked through economy–energy–environment interactions. We are increasingly aware, at the same time, that the emergence of the global community does not imply an integrated harmonious world; rather, it is a community where co- tries/regions of different interests and values face each other directly. Global governance has to be achieved through actions of national governments under different motives and constraints. We need to have an analytical tool that is capable of producing a global picture, yet with detailed country resolution. If the world is a better place now compared to 100 years ago in terms of p- capita income, this is due to the industrialization that continued throughout the 20th century. We entered the 21st century knowing that the human aspiration that translates into ever-increasing production may not be tenable in the long run. Sustainability of the global community is at stake. In contrast to inc- mental decision making through the market mechanism that should lead to some optimal state under some assumptions such as perfect knowledge, smooth movement of resources, no externalities, and so forth, we need to have an a- lytical tool to provide us with details of the future state of the world.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">The workplace is changing drastically these days. As a consequence of the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) revolution, new economic activities emerge, the production process changes, people use different communication tools, and organizational structures are adjusted. All these changes relate to the heart of business and economics, and there is no doubt that they will also influence education in these areas. Of course ICT provides new technologies to facilitate learning, but a changing workplace also requires a renewed focus within the curriculum of economics and business education. If ICT is leading to profound change in the workplace, is innovation then only a matter of introducing more technology in education? Unfortunately, this is not necessarily true. The translation of changes in the workplace into an improved curriculum requires serious analysis of the essence of the changes at the work place, and the way technology may enable student learning. For example, relevant knowledge is changing faster and faster. Does this mean that we have to adopt the curriculum faster and faster? Perhaps not, as students will have a labor market career of 30 or 40 years. Focusing on today’s knowledge – even if it is very up-to-date – loses more and more value if the life cycle of knowledge becomes shorter. Increased speed of change also implies a decrease in the value of knowing all these things.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">I knew nothing of the work of C. G. Vayenas on NEMCA until the early nineties. Then I learned from a paper of his idea (gas interface reactions could be catalyzed electrochemically), which seemed quite marvelous; but I did not understand how it worked. Consequently, I decided to correspond with Professor Vayenas in Patras, Greece, to reach a better understanding of this concept. I think that my early papers (1946, 1947, and 1957), on the relationship between the work function of metal surfaces and electron transfer reactions thereat to particles in solution, held me in good stead to be receptive to what Vayenas told me. As the electrode potential changes, so of course, does the work function at the interface, and gas metal reactions there involve adsorbed particles which have bonding to the surface. Whether electron transfer is complete in such a case, or whether the effect is on the desorption of radicals, the work function determines the strength of their bonding, and if one varies the work function by varying the electrode potential, one can vary the reaction rate at the interface. I got the idea. After that, it has been smooth sailing. Dr. Vayenas wrote a seminal article in Modern Aspects of Electrochemistry, Number 29, and brought the field into the public eye. It has since grown and its usefulness in chemical catalytic reactions has been demonstrated and verified worldwide.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">“Electrocrystallization is a particular case of a first order phase transition” and “Electrocrystallization is a particular case of electrochemical kinetics” are two statements that I have heard and read many times. I do not like them for a simple reason: it is annoying to see that the subject to which you have devoted more than 30 years of your life may be considered as a “particular case”. Therefore, I decided to write this book in which Electrocrystallization is the main subject. To become competent in the field of Electrocrystallization one should possess knowledge of Electrochemistry, Nucleation and Crystal Growth, which means knowledge of Physical Chemistry, Physics and Mathematics. That is certainly difficult and in most cases those who study Electrocrystallization are either more electrochemists, or more physical chemists, or more physicists, very often depending on whom has been their teacher. Of course, there are scientists who consider themselves equally good in all those fields. Very frequently they are, unfortunately, equally bad. The difference is essential but strange enough, it is sometimes not easy to realize the truth immediately.</dcvalue>

This book explores a range of new memory products and technologies. The concept for some of these memories has been around for years. A few completely new. Some involve materials that have been in volume production in other type of devices for some time. Ferro-electrics, for example, have been used in capacitors for more than 30 years. In addition to looking at using known devices and materials in novel ways, there are new technologies being investigated such as DNA memories, light memories, molecular memories, and carbon nanotube memories, as well as the new polymer memories which hold the potential for the significant manufacturing reduction. Emerging Memories: Technologies and Trends is a useful reference for the professional engineer in the semiconductor industry.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Emulsification of vegetable oil-based resins was a daunting task when the author began his research, but the subsequent technology spawned a generation of stable emulsions for waterborne coatings based on vegetable oil-based alkyd resins, oils and fatty acids. Autoxidative polymerization of emulsified alkyd resins is an innovative and original contribution to emulsion technology, because conventional emulsion-polymerization is not applicable to alkyd resins. Emulsified alkyd particles are polymerized while dispersed in stable aqueous media—an original and patented innovation. Smooth and fa- drying alkyd coatings are generated from non-polymerized emulsions and air-dried with conventional metal driers, and have met with marketing success. The pre-polymerization innovation for emulsified alkyd particles provides very fast air-drying coatings that have potential markets for interior architectural latex coatings and waterborne pressure-sensitive adhesives and inks. The author demonstrates his knowledge of chemical reaction kinetics by employing a combination of oxygen concentration, internal reactor pressure and other reactor variables to finely control the rate and degree of autoxidative polymerization. He meticulously calculates surfactant chemistry by measuring hydrophile-lipophile balance values, and solubility parameters to emulsify characterized resins. The relationship between hydrophi- lipophile values and solubility parameters is shown in explicit equations. Homogenization equipment used during the course of this research to generate emulsions is shown in detailed drawings together with concise particle size and distribution data. The author reports research spawned internationally by his research in the fields of alkyd-acrylic hybrids, polyester and oil-modified urethane resins.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">ERP: The Dynamics of Supply Chain and Process Management is a complete updating and expansion of Avraham Shtub’s award-winning 1999 text Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP): The Dynamics of Operations Management. New chapters, written together with his co-author Reuven Karni, cover enterprise process modeling; design of business processes; a complete revision of the original chapter on the integrated order-fulfillment process using ERP; business process management; business process improvement; and a new appendix on simulating process life cycles: using serious games as teaching aids, along with a complete description of and instructions for using the CD containing MERPTM – a Dynamic Case Study Simulator (DCSS) from MBE Simulations Ltd. MERPTM is designed to facilitate the teaching of integrated operations of a business organization with a focus on corporate performance management. It reflects a fully live environment and allows students to participate in a virtual organization made real and dynamic as minute-by-minute business events and conditions unfold. This book is ideal for use in academic and executive programs aimed at teaching students how integrated systems work. It is suitable as a textbook for the basic MBA Operations Management course or as a text for courses on ERP systems and the development of business processes. In an industrial engineering program it could serve to give students their first, and perhaps only, introduction to business issues like market demand and supplier relationships. "I used Avy Shtub’s award-winning 1999 book on ERP and the accompanying Operations Trainer software in several leading MBA programs in the United States and Europe. Most of the courses were delivered in traditional classroom settings but some of them were offered fully online. The current revision and second edition of the book, co-written with Reuven Karni, adds new materials with an emphasis on services and business processes, provides excellent, detailed examples, and revises old ones of the previous edition. The book is nicely complemented and enhanced by the addition of a unique, dynamic, online simulation package MERP™ that represents a major upgrade to the old, PC-based Operations Trainer. In my reading, the book’s first main theme, Integrated Production and Order Management (IPOM), is a different, and perhaps more valid, take on the many issues associated with Supply Chain Management. The authors touch on all facets and issues of Operations and Supply Chain Management and provide a theory-based and sound, practice-proven approach to the problems present in any organization. The second main theme covers the design and improvement of enterprise and business processes, touching on facets and issues relating to process-based enterprise management. I would highly recommend the book and the accompanying software to any instructor teaching Operations/Supply Chain Management, Business Process Management or Industrial Engineering." -- Gyula Vastag (Corvinus University of Budapest, Hungary)</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Without a clear and organized view of where and how entrepreneurship manifests itself, policy makers have been left in uncharted waters without an analytical compass. The purpose of this book is to provide such an analytical compass for directing how public policy can shape and promote entrepreneurship. We do this in two ways. The first is to provide a framework for policymakers and scholars to understand what determines entrepreneurship. The second is to apply this framework to a series of cases, or country studies. In particular, this book seeks to answer three questions about entrepreneurship: What has happened over time? Why did it happen? And, what has been the role of government policy? The cornerstone of the book is the proposed Eclectic Theory of Entrepreneurship. The goal of the Eclectic Theory is to provide a unified framework for understanding and analyzing the determinants of entrepreneurship. The Eclectic Theory of entrepreneurship integrates the different strands from relevant fields into a unifying, coherent framework. At the heart of the Eclectic Theory is the integration of factors shaping the demand for entrepreneurship on the one hand, with those influencing the supply of entrepreneurs on the other hand. The key to understanding the role of public policy is through identifying those channels shifting either the demand for or the supply of entrepreneurship by policy instruments. The findings in this book show that, by utilizing the framework provided by the Eclectic Theory of Entrepreneurship, it is within the grasp of policymakers to identify the determinants of entrepreneurship in a particular country setting at a particular point in time. This will be essential in formulating new public policies to promote entrepreneurship and, ultimately, economic growth, job creation and international competitiveness.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">In the previous edition of this book, the predominant theme was applying epidemiology to assist managers in dealing with an environment in which the structure of health care financing was rapidly changing to managed care and in which there was increasing competition among health care providers. While these phenomena continue to exist, new challenges have emerged, and in particular the explosion of information technology has given way to a global society and decision making that is increasingly shared with consumers because of their access to the same sets of data. Thus, the questions with which health care managers are confronted on a daily basis are now exceedingly more complex: (1) How can a population be defined considering that both exposures and diseases originating in one corner of the globe can rapidly become a threat to any nation’s security? (2) Where do influences on a population begin and end? (3) How can we protect and promote health in that population or any population if privacy is preeminent? This edition brings in this editor’s view of the increasing need for health care managers, be they in private or public settings, to use epidemiological concepts and methods. The ch- lenges posed by health care delivery in the 21st century are immense, ranging from redefining life and health given the advances in genetic technology, global environmental changes, and multinational simultaneous increases in poverty and longevity, to economic decisions rega- ing technology and service levels that fewer and fewer can afford.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Ethics in Community Mental Health Care: Commonplace Concerns examines everyday ethical issues that clinicians encounter as they go about their work caring for people who have severe and persistent mental disorders. Individuals (psychiatrists, social workers, case managers, nurses, psychologists, peer counselors, primary care physicians) who serve on the front line of community mental health clinical and social services find that they must deal, on a daily basis, with significant ethical dilemmas that involve personal, social, and policy matters: overstepping personal boundaries and coercive practices, dealing with violence in the home and in the workplace, breaching confidentiality, and ensuring the rights and welfare of vulnerable individuals. This book prompts and provokes readers to recognize, to analyze, to reflect upon, and to respond to the range of commonplace ethical concerns that arise in community mental health care practice with persons who have mental disorders that may impede their ability to protect their own interests.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">"James Altschuld, David Kumar, and their chapter authors have produced an upbeat, provocative, visionary, and useful volume on educational evaluation. Of special utility is its grounding in issues and practices relating to evaluations of science and technology education. The book should appeal and be useful to a wide range of persons involved in evaluations of educational policy, programs, and (less so) science teachers. These persons include science and technology education experts, educational policymakers, officials of the National Science Foundation, school administrators, classroom teachers, evaluation instructors, evaluation methodologists, practicing evaluators, and test developers, among others. Contents reflecting international studies of curriculum, evaluation of distance education, and evaluation of technology utilization in Australian schools, as well as evaluations in America should make the book appealing to an international audience. Moreover, it provides a global perspective for assessing and strengthening educational evaluation in the US." Daniel L.

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Fabricating Europe has within it a core idea, a crucial but imprecise idea, that of a European educational space, which transnational governance, networks and cultural and economic projects are creating now. Yet, the perceptible creation of this contemporary space of European policy making and networking has not been a subject of study. It appears offstage in studies of national systems in which national and professional identity; political organization; policy formation and public/private markets are all viewed as contained within the borders of the state. Fabricating Europe is concerned with the new possibilities to be discerned and imagined in the European public and institutional spaces and discourses in education and the lack of impetus within the broad area of educational studies to meet the task of creating analyses and responses.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Information on future mortality trends is essential for population forecasts, public health policy, actuarial studies, and many other purposes. Realising the importance of such needs, this volume contains contributions to the theory and practice of forecasting mortality in the relatively favourable circumstances in developed countries of Western Europe. In this context techniques from mathematical statistics and econometrics can provide useful descriptions of past mortality. The naive forecast obtained by extrapolating a fitted model may give as good a forecast as any but forecasting by extrapolation requires careful justification since it assumes the prolongation of historical conditions. On the other hand, whilst it is generally accepted that scientific and other advances will continue to impact on mortality, perhaps dramatically so, it is impossible to quantify more than the outline of future consequences with a strong degree of confidence. The decision to modify an extrapolation of a model fitted to historical data (or conversely choosing not to modify it) in order to obtain a forecast is therefore strongly influenced by subjective and judgmental elements, with the quality of the latter dependent on demographic, epidemiological and indeed perhaps more general considerations. The thread running through the book reflects therefore the necessity of integrating demographic, epidemiological, and statistical factors to obtain an improvement in the prediction of mortality.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Although in nature the vast majority of polymers are condensation polymers, much publicity has been focused on functionalized vinyl polymers. Functional Condensation Polymers fulfills the need to explore these polymers which form an increasingly important and diverse foundation in the search for new materials in the twentyfirst century. Some of the advantages condensation polymers hold over vinyl polymers include offering different kinds of binding sites, their ability to be made biodegradable, and their different reactivities with various reagents under diverse reaction conditions. They also offer better tailoring of end-products, different tendencies (such as fiber formation), and different physical and chemical properties. Some of the main areas emphasized include dendrimers, control release of drugs, nanostructure materials, controlled biomedical recognition, and controllable electrolyte and electrical properties.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">As quantum theory enters its second century, it is fitting to examine just how far it has come as a tool for the chemist. Beginning with Max Planck’s agonizing conclusion in 1900 that linked energy emission in discreet bundles to the resultant black-body radiation curve, a body of knowledge has developed with profound consequences in our ability to understand nature. In the early years, quantum theory was the providence of physicists and certain breeds of physical chemists. While physicists honed and refined the theory and studied atoms and their component systems, physical chemists began the foray into the study of larger, molecular systems. Quantum theory predictions of these systems were first verified through experimental spectroscopic studies in the electromagnetic spectrum (microwave, infrared and ultraviolet/visible), and, later, by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Over two generations these studies were hampered by two major drawbacks: lack of resolution of spectroscopic data, and the complexity of calculations. This powerful theory that promised understanding of the fundamental nature of molecules faced formidable challenges. The following example may put things in perspective for today’s chemistry faculty, college seniors or graduate students: As little as 40 years ago, force field calculations on a molecule as simple as ketene was a four to five year dissertation project.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">In the last twenty-five years, game theory has been applied to a growing number of practical problems: from antitrust analysis to monetary policy; from the design of auction institutions to the structuring of incentives within firms; from patent races to dispute resolution. The purpose of Game Theory and Business Applications is to expand these applications of game theory into a broad and meaningful view of the way business decisions can be modelled and analyzed. The chapter contents embrace a wide variety of business functions - from accounting to finance, to operations, to strategy, and to organizational design. In addition, specific application areas include numerous kinds of market competition, bargaining, auctions and competitive bidding. All of these applications involve competitive decision settings, specifically situations where a number of economic agents in pursuit of their respective self-interests take actions that together affect all of their fortunes. In the language of game theory, players take actions consistent with the given `rules of the game,' and these joint actions determine final outcomes and payoffs. As this volume demonstrates, game theory provides a compelling guide for business strategy. The first section of this volume discusses game-theoretic applications in four functional areas of business: finance, accounting, operations management and information systems, and organization design. The second section considers competitive strategies in `imperfect' markets. Using cooperative and non-cooperative game-theoretic approaches, these four chapters consider various topics: spatial competition, signaling of product quality, trust and cooperation in ongoing relationships, strategic behavior in bargaining, and the `balance of power' between the firm and its buyers and suppliers. The last section of the book deals in detail with auctions and competitive bidding institutions. The emphasis is on the contributions of game theory to both auction theory and practice. Topics considered include optimal auctions, bidder collusion, and the design of institutions for selling the radio spectrum and trading electrical power.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Health researchers routinely evaluate health and illness across subgroups defined by their sex, gender, ethnicity, and race. All too often, these classifications are proffered as an explanation for any differences that may be detected, for example, in access to care, frequency of disease, or response to treatment. Relatively few researchers, however, have examined what these classifications mean on a theoretical level or in the context of their own research. Assume, for example, that a researcher concludes from his or her data that African- Americans utilize certain surgical procedures less frequently than whites. This conclusion may mean little without an examination of the various underlying issues. Is there such a construct as race at all? How were whites and African-Americans classified as such? Does this finding reflect inappropriate overutilization of the specific procedures among whites or inappropriate underutilization among African-Americans? To what extent are socioeconomic status and method of payment related to the less frequent use? Are there differences in the manner in which health care providers present the various treatment options to whites and to African- Americans that could account for these differences in utilization? Are there differences in health care-seeking and health care preferences between the two groups that would explain the difference in utilization? Is the racial classification a surrogate measure for another variable that has remained unidentified and unmeasured? All too often, unfortunately, such issues are ignored or lightly dismissed with an entreaty for additional research.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">`Why life?' Questions of this type were for a long time the prerogative of philosophers who left the `how' question to scientists. Nowadays, Darwin's successors no longer have any qualms about addressing the `why' as well as the `how'. Over a century ago, Darwin modestly admitted having 'thrown some light on the origin of species - this mystery of mysteries'. Two major advances in the following decades helped biologists answer many of the questions he left unsolved. The first was the discovery of the laws of heredity, the second that of DNA. Both provided Darwinian theory with the foundations that were lacking and led to the all-embracing neo-Darwinian synthesis. Since then, Theodosius Dobzhansky's aphorism `nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution' has proven true more than once. This does not suit everyone, as evolutionist ideas have not lost their power to cause a scandal. Darwin toppled man from his pedestal. Evolutionary genetics - the subject of this book - sends the individual crashing. Considered until recently to be the target of selection and the focus of evolution, the individual has been usurped by the gene. The individual is nothing but the gene's avatar.</dcvalue>

The book touches upon a wide range of issues such as solvability of boundary values problems for partial differential equations with generalized right-hand sides, the existence of optimal controls, the necessary conditions of optimality, the controllability of systems, numerical methods of approximation of generalized solutions of initial boundary value problems with generalized data, and numerical methods for approximation of optimal controls. In particular, the problems of optimization of linear systems with lumped controls (pulse, point, pointwise, mobile and so on) are investigated in detail.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Over the past decade, our laboratory and others have been concerned with molecular archaeological studies aimed at revealing the origins and evolutionary histories of permeases (1). These studies have revealed that several different families, defined on the basis of sequence similarities, arose independently of each other, at different times in evolutionary history, following different routes. When complete microbial genomes first became available for analysis, we adapted p- existing software and designed new programs that allowed us quickly to identify probable transmembrane proteins, estimate their topologies and determine the likelihood that they function in transport (2). This work allowed us to expand previously-recognized families and to identify dozens of new families. All of this work then led us to attempt to design a rational but comprehensive classification system that would be applicable to the complete complement of transport systems found in all living organisms (3). The classification system that we have devised is based primarily on mode of transport and energy coupling mechanism, secondarily on molecular phylogeny, and lastly on the substrate specificities of the individual permeases (4).</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Geographic Location in the Internet discusses how to find the location of mobile devices in the wireless Internet, specifically those that involve the determination of the geographic location of mobile devices. 2G systems of GSM, GPRS and 3G systems of UMTS and cdma2000, and other link technologies and an extensive description on how numerical location of the mobile can be tracked real-time also are discussed. Geographic Location in the Internet covers Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) related geographic location tracking as it relates to multimedia applications. The recent application-layer protocols for communicating the location information from the mobile device to the applications such as multimedia applications are also covered. Mobile Location Protocol (MLP) of the Location Information Forum (LIF) allows access of the geographic location information to the applications using Web protocol of HTTP. The Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) forum also defined a technical specification for location-based services, which is discussed in detail. A detailed analysis of the location update mechanisms covers various technical issues in location database design, and protocols are compared using simulations and providing provocative conclusions. Geographic search engines utilizing location data that enable users to make location related queries on the Web are also covered. The book has exclusive coverage of the technical aspects of privacy such as linkability, credentials, pseudonyms, anonymity and identity management. Different scenarios are defined for the targets, owners, location servers and location data sources and the privacy implications are emphasized.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Autopsy derives from the greek word autopsia, which means act of seeing with one’s own eyes. It remains the most objective and accurate method to understand human. disease. Unfortunately, the volume of autopsies in teaching hospitals has decreased dramatically over the past years. The crucial factors that account for this are the recent progress and development of new technologies, especially in diagnostic imaging, immunology, cell biology and genetics. Additionally, the perpetual fear of legal liability by physicians accounts for its further decline. Consequently, physicians and medical students are engaged in fewer autopsies and are not reaping the rich educational rewards that accompany these examinations. The purpose of the autopsy is not only to establish the cause of death, but also to determine the nature and course of the disease process. Our goal with this book is to emphasize the importance of the post-mortem exam and the correlation between pathologic material and clinical data by analyzing actual cases with problem-based methodology. The focus of this handbook is on cardiovascular disease, and when appropriate, other disease categories are included if they have an impact on cardiovascular function. The approach is more than the usual clinico-pathological correlation. Rather, we attempt to present the material from the perspective of the autopsy table. We use the clinical data as the initial framework and the autopsy findings to develop a true understanding of the disease and the associated pathophysiology of the condition.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">With the exponential growth of the number of Internet nodes, the volume of the data transported on the backbone has increased with the same trend. The load of the global Internet backbone will soon increase to tens of terabits per second. This indicates that the backbone bandwidth requirements will increase by a factor of 50 to 100 every seven years. Transportation of such high volumes of data requires suitable media with low loss and high bandwidth. Among the available transmission media, optical fibers achieve the best performance in terms of loss and bandwidth. High-speed data can be transported over hundreds of kilometers of single-mode fiber without significant loss in signal integrity. These fibers progressively benefit from reduction of cost and improvement of perf- mance. Meanwhile, the electronic interfaces used in an optical network are not capable of exploiting the ultimate bandwidth of the fiber, limiting the throughput of the network. Different solutions at both the system and the circuit levels have been proposed to increase the data rate of the backbone. System-level solutions are based on the utilization of wave-division multiplexing (WDM), using different colors of light to transmit s- eral sequences simultaneously. In parallel with that, a great deal of effort has been put into increasing the operating rate of the electronic transceivers using highly-developed fabrication processes and novel c- cuit techniques.</dcvalue>
