 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">The motivation and inspiration for this book come directly from expe- ences with clients during the years that I practiced HIV-related law at the Legal Aid Society of San Diego, Inc. The issues discussed in this work reflect issues that arose on a recurring basis with clients participating in HIV research studies, with investigators calling for guidance on the legal implications of particular aspects of their proposed studies, and with research institutions and health care facilities struggling to make sense of legal maneuvers aimed at obtaining the records of their HIV-infected patients. It is impossible to thank each of these persons individually for their provocative questions and their insights. The discussion of ethical and legal issues relating to the design of clinical trials reflects questions raised during discussions with Donald J. Slymen, Ph.D. Don was one of the first researchers, in my realm of experience, to pay close attention to ethical concerns, and I am greatly appreciative of his contribution to both my professional growth and the development of various scenarios discussed in this text. The portions of this text dealing with confidentiality are the result of many hours of thoughtful discussion and analysis with Penn Lerblance, J.D., now deceased and still missed. Penn and I often participated together as presenters of in-service training programs for health prof- sionals. Penn addressed discrimination, and I focused on confidentiality.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Here, Erich H. Loewy expands on his earlier book Textbook of Medical Ethics (1989) offering healthcare workers and students a new perspective on ethical practice. Textbook of Healthcare Ethics focuses on the social conditions in which medical practice occurs and how ethical healthcare decisions involves nurses, social workers, psychologists, technicians, and patients as well as physicians. This thoroughly revised and expanded edition addresses historical and theoretical underpinnings and practical concerns. A series of case studies serve as a guideline for further discussion. The text examines provocative issues such as organ donation, care of the terminally ill, abortion, HIV-positive healthcare professionals, physician-assisted suicide, and experimentation with fetal tissue. This is an ideal book for all members of the healthcare team as well as students and residents in any discipline of medicine.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Although virology and immunology are now considered separate disciplines, history shows that these areas ofinvestigation always overlapped and one cannot really exist without the other. This trend has become particularly significant and fruitful in the past few years in the area of herpesvirus research. The genomes of the most important herpesviruses have been sequenced, a significant portion of their genes have been identified, and many secrets of regulation of gene expr- sion have been unraveled. Now this progress sets the stage for a true revolution in herpesvirus research: analysis of interactions between the host and the virus. Because herpesviruses can induce, suppress, and fool the immune system, the most productive herpesvirologists are also expert immunologists, and the current results ofthis interdisciplinary effort are truly remarkable. Because herpesviruses cause many important human diseases, the devel- ment of vaccines against these agents is a very significant goal. This effort is also very challenging because of the complexity of herpesviruses and the lack of sufficient information about immune responses. The remarkable ability of herpesviruses to escape immune responses is - other feature that brings immunology and virology together. Herpesviruses - code many proteins that interact with and down-regulate some key elements of the immune system. Thisproperty of herpesviruses represents amajor challenge in developing strategies against these viruses. On the positive side, these viral proteins also provide novel tools for analyzing specific immune reactions and molecular mechanisms.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Nearly, 50 years ago, Karl Pribram in a discussion section accompanying MacLean’s proposal of a limbic system, criticized the visceral or limbic brain concept as theoretically too vague and cumbersome. In a recent review of the limbic system, Swanson points to Brodal’s criticism that the discovery of connections of limbic structures with virtually all parts of the nervous system render the concept of the limbic system useless, and better abandoned. Additional dissatisfaction surrounding the limbic brain concept stems from the feeling that it is historically inert (an antiquated 19th century construct). In our current age of neural networks, and parallel distributed process it is of little value, merely an historical curio. So why then this int- duction to limbic brain anatomy? We offer several interrelated rationales behind our labors. Recapitulation in the Service of Education: Although concepts had evolved in the second half of this century which effectively overthrew the idea of relatively isolated hemispheric districts (i. e. striatal, cortical, and limbic), parsing the hemisphere into these three districts was an important preliminary step achieved by our forebears in their efforts to understand the large scale structure of the higher mammalian cerebral hemisphere. An examination of how the limbic brain concept came to be provides an opp- tunity to recapitulate the process of exploration, discovery, and und- standing as it relates to one of these principle hemispheric domains.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Familiarity with nitric oxide is essential to a modern understanding of pathophysiologic mechanisms of infectious disease. Recent research has established nitric oxide and related reactive nitrogen intermediates to be important molecular mediators of diverse physiologic processes such as control of vascular tone, regulation of the immune system, and microbial and tumor cell growth. This book contains chapters by the leading researchers in the field and examines the biology and biochemistry of nitric oxide and its role in a variety of specific infections ranging from sepsis, tuberculosis and malaria to viral myocarditis, influenza, and AIDS.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">With the coming of the new millennium we are witnessing a revolution in our understanding of cancer genetics. These are very exciting times. Today we have at our disposal the technology to diagnose abnormalities in our cancer genes and the means to correct the deficit and very soon we will have the complete sequence of the human genome. With the use of gene chip technology the way doctors will be able to assess patients will change completely. Today we can diagnose abnormalities in ten thousand genes and within a short period of time we will be able to screen through our genome and discover potential abnormalities in our proto-oncogenes, tumour suppressor genes, differentiating genes, apoptotic genes and pro-inflammatory genes. In this book various authors have highlighted specific genes that could be expressed, overexpressed, neutralised or h- nessed to achieve cancer control. The problem of transferring the therapeutic gene into the cancer cell has been partly addressed with major developments in the field of naked plasmid DNA, adenovirus, retrovirus and adeno-associated viruses. However, further improvements are yet to be made to achieve significant gene transfer. Gene expression, in particular specificity of gene transfer, is obviously an important issue and one which is highlighted in this book by the use of specific promoter.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">The discovery of the human T cell leukemia virus type I in the late 1970s heralded a new era in retrovirology. For the first time, it was demonstrated that a retrovirus could play a role in the development of a human disease, in this case adult T cell leukemia (ATL). Several years later, the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) epidemic began, and it was dem- strated that a retrovirus, originally designated the human T cell lymp- tropic virus type 3, was the causal agent of this syndrome. This virus, later named the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), has since been extensively studied in terms of its pathogenesis as well as its ability to elicit immune responses. In that time, a tremendous amount of information has been obtained about the virus. Although recent drug regimens have been useful in significantly lowering viral loads and perhaps maintaining an asymptomatic state among individuals infected with HIV-1, an established “cure” for AIDS eludes us. In addition, the effective drug therapies are very expensive, and are not available to infected people in the third world, where greater than 90% of new infections occur. Furthermore, the development of viral resistance against the drug therapies is an additional concern. Despite extensive study, no effective vaccine has been developed. One of the problems in developing an effective vaccine against HIV-1 is the ability of the virus, particularly in the immunogenic envelop glycoprotein, to undergo amino acid hypervariability.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">In the pharmaceutical industry, the incorporation of the disciplines of pharma- kinetics, pharmacodynamics, and drug metabolism (PK/PD/DM) into various drug development processes has been recognized to be extremely important for approp- ate compound selection and optimization. During discovery phases, the identifi- tion of the critical PK/PD/DM issues of new compounds plays an essential role in understanding their pharmacological profiles and structure-activity relationships. Owing to recent progress in analytical chemistry, a large number of compounds can be screened for their PK/PD/DM properties within a relatively short period of time. During development phases as well, the toxicology and clinical study designs and trials of a compound should be based on a thorough understanding of its PK/PD/DM properties. During my time as an industrial scientist, I realized that a reference work designed for practical industrial applications of PK/PD/DM could be a very valuable tool for researchers not only in the pharmacokinetics and drug metabolism departments, but also for other discovery and development groups in pharmaceutical companies. This book is designed specifically for industrial scientists, laboratory assistants, and managers who are involved in PK/PD/DM-related areas. It consists of thirteen chapters, each of which deals with a particular PK/PD/DM issue and its industrial applications. Chapters 3 and 12 in particular address recent topics on higher throughput in vivo exposure screening and the prediction of pharmacokinetics in humans, respectively. Chapter 8 covers essential information on drug metabolism for industrial scientists.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Genome research will certainly be one of the most important and exciting sci- tific disciplines of the 21st century. Deciphering the structure of the human genome, as well as that of several model organisms, is the key to our understanding how genes fu- tion in health and disease. With the combined development of innovativetools, resources, scientific know-how, and an overall functional genomic strategy, the origins of human and other organisms’geneticdiseases can be traced. Scientificresearch groups and dev- opmental departments of several major pharmaceutical and biotechnological companies are using new, innovative strategies to unravel how genes function, elucidating the gene protein product, understanding how genes interact with others-both in health and in the disease state. Presently, the impact of the applications of genome research on our society in medicine, agriculture and nutrition will be comparable only to that of communication technologies. In fact, computational methods, including networking, have been playing a substantial role even in genomics and proteomics from the beginning. We can observe, however, a fundamental change of the paradigm in life sciences these days: research focused until now mostly on the study of single processes related to a few genes or gene products, but due to technical developments of the last years we can now potentially identify and analyze all genes and gene products of an organism and clarify their role in the network of lifeprocesses.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Membrane fusion and targeting processes are tightly regulated and coordinated. Dozens of proteins, originating from both the cytoplasm and membranes are involved. The discovery of homologous proteins from yeast to neurons validates a unified view. Although much is known about the interfering proteins, the events occurring when two lipid bilayers actually fuse are less clear. It should be remembered that lipid bilayers behave like soap-bubbles fusing when meeting each other. In this respect interfering proteins should be considered as preventing undesirable and unnecessary fusion and eventually directing the biological membrane fusion process (when, where, how, and overcoming the activation energy). In this latest volume in the renowned Subcellular Biochemistry series, some aspects of fusion of biological membranes as well as related problems are presented. Although not complete, there is a lot of recent information including on virus-induced membrane fusion. The contributors of the chapters are all among the researchers who performed many of the pioneering studies in the field.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">This text examines the dominant ways of looking at patient/clinician relationships in healthcare. By challenging these dominant views the author can explore presuppositions that are defective. She further explains how they come to be so readily and uncritically held and reinforced; and, why their implications can have such a profound affect on how we think and act. Using the methodology of philosopher, John Dewey, the author proposes an alternative bio/psycho/social approach to understanding the patient/clinician relationship and for resolving increasingly common bioethical issues that arise in healthcare settings.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">In recent years increased scientific attention has been given to immediate defense mechanisms based on non-clonal recognition of microbial components. These mechanisms constitute the innate immunity arm of the body s defense. Identification of pathogens by these mechanisms involves primarily receptors recognizing sugar moieties of various microorganisms. Innate immunity based mechanisms are essential for the existence of multicellular organisms. They are evolutionarily conserved and designed to provide immediate protection against microbial pathogens to eradicate infection. Activation of innate immunity is crucial for transition to specific immunity and for its orientation, and to assist the specific immune response in the recognition of pathogens and their destruction. Innate immunity is regularly involved in the arrest of bacterial, mycotic, viral and parasitic infections, giving the specific immune response time to become effective. It becomes critically essential in immunocompromised patients who fail to mount specific immune responses due to congenital or acquired immunodeficiencies as a result of chemotherapy, dialysis, immunosuppressive drugs, or HIV infection. The Innate Immunity arsenal constitutes polymorphonuclear and mononuclear phagocytes, mast cells, the complement system, Natural Killer cells, antimicrobial peptides, and presumably a subset of T lymphocytes with TCRl receptors.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Proceedings of the European Cooperation in the Field of Scientific and Technical Research (COST 825) Symposium on Mammary Gland Biology, held September 16-18, 1999, in Tours, France. It is difficult to overstate the evolutionary and functional significance of mammary tissue in biology. Substantial progress has been made by researchers in various disciplines, particularly over the last fifteen years, towards realizing the potential of this tissue to yield powerful experimental models for morphogenesis and tissue development; for cellular differentiation; for the biosynthesis and secretion of proteins, lipids, small molecules and inorganic salts; and for the coordination and regulation of these processes. More recently, the possibility of exploiting the secretory epithelial cells of mammary tissue as `cell factories' has become a reality and the recombinant production by lactating animals of an increasing number of proteins, valuable both in the pharmaceutical and `nutraceutical' fields, is in progress or under development. Also in this sphere of agricultural production, genetic as well as nutritional technologies are under investigation and exploitation to optimize milk composition for various end-uses - for instance in food process and manufacture. The possibilities of deriving health benefit from the bioactive properties of some of the minor constituents of milk are emerging to counter the highly-publicized negative health impact of excessive consumption of saturated animal fats. In human nutrition and medicine, the mammary gland is both a source of nutrition to the neonate and a potential health threat to the adult female - breast cancer remains the major single cause of female mortality in most developed countries. This volume provides a unique glimpse into our understanding, at the cutting edge of a variety of disciplines, of this versatile and extraordinary tissue, at the birth of the twenty-first century.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Pneumonia (along with influenza) is the sixth leading cause of death in adults. About 4 million adults develop pneumonia each year in the US, resulting in 64 million days of restricted activity, 39 million days of bed confinement, and 10 million days of lost work. Yet the admission rates to hospital, length of stay, investigations, antimicrobial therapy and prevention strategies vary greatly from one geographic area to the next, and the scientific basis for many of our management strategies for pneumonia is weak to nonexistent. There are over 100 microbial agents that can cause pneumonia and many of these, especially Streptococcus pneumoniae, Group A streptococcus, and Staphylococcus aureus, are in a state of flux in terms of changing antimicrobial resistance. This book is designed to provide new information about pneumonia and identify critical research questions that will come to the fore as we enter the 21st century.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Mitochondria are organelles in each cell outside the nucleus and are the energy source of all cells. As such, they are crucial to the healthy functioning of cells. Recent research has shown that mitochondrial dysfunction underlies a broad spectrum of disease, from maternally inherited genetic disorders to metabolism defects, aging, stroke, and neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, and Lou Gehrig's disease. This book brings together top researchers whose work in examining the pathophysiologic processes will lead to new strategies for prevention and treatment.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Today we have more control over how we live and how we die than we ever had before. This fact has produced many ethical problems. While much about life is biologically determined, much else is determined by the social circumstances surrounding it. Unfortunately, little energy is spent dealing with the social and psychological factors within which the medical/biological factors are imbedded. In this volume the authors examine some of the medical social and psychological conditions which affect the way we die. Important topics covered include attitudes toward death; suicide, assisted suicide and euthanasia; hospice and pain management. This volume will be of interest to all who work with terminally ill patients.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">The International Ethical Guidelines for Biomedical Research Involving Human Subjects (CIOMS and WHO, 1993: 11) defines “research” as referring to a class of activities designed to develop or contribute to generalizable knowledge. Generalizable knowledge consists of theories, principles or relationships, or the accumulation of information on which they are based, that can be corroborated by accepted scientific techniques of observation and inference. The International Guidelines for the Ethical Review of Epidemiological Studies (CIOMS, 1991) recognizes that it may be difficult to distinguish between research and program evaluation. It offers the following guidance: “The defining attribute of research is that it is designed to produce new, generalizable knowledge, as distinct from knowledge pertaining only to a particular individual or programme” (CIOMS, 1991, Guideline 52,23). Health research includes both medical and behavioral studies that relate to health. Research can be conducted in conjunction with patient care (clinical research), or it can be conducted outside of the context of clinical care. Research may involve only observation, or it may require, instead or in combination, a physical, chemical, or psychological intervention. Research may generate new records or may rely on already-existing records.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">The human brain contains more than a billion neurons which interconnect to form networks that process, store, and recall sensory information. These neuronal activities are supported by a group of accessory brain cells coll- tively known as neuroglia. Surprisingly, glial cells are ten times more - merous than neurons, and occupy more than half the brain volume (Hydén, 1961). Although long considered a passive, albeit necessary, component of the nervous system, many interesting and unusual functional properties of glial cells are only now being brought to light. As a result, the status of these cellular elements is approaching parity with nerve cells as a subject for experimental study. The term glia (or glue) seems today to be a misnomer in view of the diverse functions attributed to glial cells. Experimental studies in the last three decades have clearly established that the behavior of glial cells is far from passive, and that they are at least as complex as neurons with regard to their membrane properties. In addition, glial cells are of importance in signal processing, cellular metabolism, nervous system development, and the pathophysiology of neurological diseases. The Müller cell of the ver- brate retina provides a splendid example of an accessory cell that exhibits features illustrating every aspect of the complex behavior now associated with glial cells.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">th This volume contains articles presented at the X International Symposium on Purines and Pyrimidines in Man, held on May 14 19, 2000 in Tel Aviv, Israel. The first symposium in this series took place in Tel Aviv in 1973. Since then, the symposium has been held every three years in different parts of the world, including Europe, USA and Japan. The participants, in this series of symposia, are characterised by a wide interest in the various aspects of purines and pyrimidines in man, which include biochemistry, genetics, pharmacology, physiology, clinics, etc. Presentations in the symposia include clarification of metabolic pathways, characterisation of enzyme structure and kinetics and discoveries of new inborn errors of metabolism and suggestions for new therapeutic approaches for these inborn errors. In addition, development of new purine and pyrimidine derivatives for the treatment of cancer and viral diseases, and many more subjects of mutual interest were brought to the fore. With the development of therapeutic means and of new research tools, we have witnessed changes in the areas of interest. The interest in gout and uric acid urolithiasis has lessened, whereas molecular aspects, the role of purine and pyrimidine substances in neurotransmission and in purinergic signaling appear to gain greater interest. The articles, included in this volume, contain new data pertaining to the various aspects detailed above.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Central nervous system (CNS) infections continue to pose a serious problem in health care even with improved knowledge and treatment. Despite the introduction of newer antimicrobial agents and diagnostic techniques, the morbidity and mortality associated with CNS infections remain high. The morbidity associated with CNS infections may be even more important than the death rate especially in developing countries as neurological sequelae may deprive the survivors of intellect and physical ability, demeaning the quality of life and burdening health resources and social services. MR imaging is an important integral part of the protocol for the management of CNS infections and MR spectroscopy is increasingly being utilized in its management. This work is an attempt to provide a comprehensive review of imaging and spectroscopy of the commonly encountered CNS infections in the clinical practice in developing and developed countries. The first chapter deals with basic physical principles of MR imaging and spectroscopy that will help beginners to understand the technical terms used in subsequent chapters. The remaining 10 chapters deal with clinical, pathological, MR imaging and spectroscopy features and their applications in CNS infections. This will help in giving a comprehensive understanding to readers with a background in clinical, radiological, basic MRI, and neurological sciences. The T2 hypointense lesions are a real diagnostic dilemma especially in developing countries for which an algorithm has been suggested in the concluding chapter.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">This volume is the result of a conference sponsored by the Medical Alumni Association of the University of California, Davis and held in Sacramento, California, in January, 2000, The purpose of this conference was to examine the impact ofvarious health care structures on the ability of health care professionals to practice in an ethically acceptable manner. One of the ground assumptions made is that ethical practice in medicine and its related fields is difficult in a setting that pays only lip service to ethical principles. The limits of ethical possibility are created by the system within which health care professionals must practice. When, for example, ethical practice necessitates—as it generally does—that health care professionals spend sufficient time to come to know and understand their patients’ goals and values but the system mandates that only a short time be spent with each patient, ethical practice is made virtually impossible. One of our chief frustrations in teaching health care ethics at medical colleges is that we essentially teach students to do something they are most likely to find impossible to do: that is, get to know and appreciate their patients’ goals and values. There are other ways in which systems alter ethical possibilities. In a system in which patients have a different physician outside the hospital than they will inside, ethical problems have a different shape than if the treating physician is the same person.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Researchers seeking problems that offer more hope of success often avoid subjects that seem to be difficult to approach experimentally, or subjects for which experimental results are difficult to interpret. The breakdown part of protein turnover in vivo, particularly in nervous tissue, was such a subject in the past – it was difficult to measure and difficult to explore the mechanisms involved. For factors that influence protein metabolism, it was thought that protein content, function, and distribution are controlled only by the synthetic mechanisms that can supply the needed specificity and response to stimuli. The role of breakdown was thought to be only a general metabolic digestion, elimination of excess polypeptides. We now know that the role of breakdown is much more complex: it has multiple functions, it is coupled to turnover, and it can affect protein composition, function, and synthesis. In addition to eliminating abnormal proteins, breakdown has many modulatory functions: it serves to activate and inactivate enzymes, modulate membrane function, alter receptor channel properties, affect transcription and cell cycle, form active peptides, and much more. The hydrolysis of peptide bonds often involves multiple steps, many enzymes, and cycles (such as ubiquination), and often requires the activity of enzyme complexes. Their activation, modification, and inactivation can thus play an important role in biological functions, with numerous families of proteases participating. The specific role of each remains to be elucidated.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Staphylococcus aureus is now acknowledged as being the most important bacterial pathogen of humans. It usually produces localized disease but can be rapidly invasive, spreading through the tissues, invading bone, and seeding the bloodstream to produce a fulminant picture of septic shock, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and rapid death. Moreover, most strains of staph infections are becoming resistant to most antibiotics, thus posing a significant problem for hospitals and health care facilities. This book, a volume in the Infectious Agents and Pathogenesis series, presents chapters by the major researchers in the field.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">The pervasive influence of law on medical practice and clinical bioethics is often noted with a combination of exasperation and lamentation. Physicians and non-physician bioethicists, generally speaking, consider the willingness of courts, legislatures, and regulatory agencies to insinuate themselves into clinical practice and medical research to be a distinctly negative aspect of contemporary American society. They are quick to point out that their colleagues in other Western developed nations are not similarly afflicted, and that the situation which obtains elsewhere is highly preferable to the legalization and purported over-regulation of medicine that has taken place in the United States during the last fifty years. In this book I offer a decidedly different perspective. It is, admittedly, not entirely without personal and professional bias. Prior to becoming a fu- time academic, teaching bioethics in the setting of an academic medical center, I was, for nearly 20 years, an attorney specializing in health law. Even after earning a doctorate in philosophy, I was frequently considered to be the “resident lawyer” on the bioethics faculty, much more frequently looked to for my insights on the law than my perspective as one who had formally studied moral philosophy and applied ethics. I note this not out ofa sense of frustration or disappointment, but as confirmation that even among physicians and n- physician bioethicists, there is widespread recognition that the law does have important contributions to make in assessing the practice ofmedicine and the conduct of medical research.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">The ongoing debate on the use of DNA profiles to identify perpetrators in criminal investigations or fathers in paternity disputes has too often been conducted with no regard to sound statistical, genetic or legal reasoning. The contributors to Human Identification: The Use of DNA Markers all have considerable experience in forensic science, statistical genetics or jurimetrics, and many of them have had to explain the scientific issues involved in using DNA profiles to judges and juries. Although the authors hold differing views on some of the issues, they have all produced accounts which pay due attention to the, sometimes troubling, issues of independence of components of the profiles and of population substructures. The book presents the considerable evolution of ideas that has occurred since the 1992 Report of the National Research Council of the U.S. Audience: Indispensable to forensic scientists, laying out the concepts to all those with an interest in the use of genetic information. The chapters and exhaustive bibliography are vital information for all lawyers who must prosecute or defend DNA cases, and to judges trying such cases.</dcvalue>

In fact, one of our major challenges is to separate this signal, the 'real' biology or chemistry, from the noise. The tools developed to do this are called, collectively, biostatistics. Any tool, even a hammer, can be misused. This could result, at best, in inefficiency, and, at worst, in disaster. With the advent of newer, us- friendly statistical software packages, desk top computing, and point-a- click technologies, it is easier than ever to make mistakes in your analyses. The beauty of having access to so much computing power is that you can now enjoy ultimate flexibility in data processing: that can also be a problem. Ask your computer to produce a particular analysis, report or graphic, and that is exactly what you will get: if you happen to have asked for the wrong thing it will be produced just as quickly, and you will probably never know it was wrong. One aim of this handbook is to help you choose the correct tool for the job at hand, understand its strengths and weaknesses, and to help you recognize when you should seek expert advice. We describe biostatistics as a collection of tools for very good reasons.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Cyanobacteria make a major contribution to world photosynthesis and nitrogen fixation, but are also notorious for causing nuisances such as dense and often toxic `blooms' in lakes and the ocean. The Ecology of Cyanobacteria: Their Diversity in Time and Space is the first book to focus solely on ecological aspects of these organisms. Its twenty-two chapters are written by some thirty authors, who are leading experts in their particular subject. The book begins with an overview of the cyanobacteria - or blue-green algae, for those who are not specialists - then looks at their diversity in the geological record and goes on to describe their ecology in present environments where they play important roles. Why is one of the key groups of organisms in the Precambrian still one of the most important groups of phototrophs today? The importance of ecological information for rational management and exploitation of these organisms for commercial and other practical purposes is also assessed. Accounts are provided of nuisances as well as the ecology of the commercially successful Spirulina and the role of cyanobacteria in ecosystem recovery from oil pollution. Many chapters include aspects of physiology, biochemistry, geochemistry and molecular biology where these help general understanding of the subject. In addition there are three chapters dealing specifically with molecular ecology. Thirty-two pages of colour photos incorporate about seventy views and light micrographs. These features make the book valuable to a wide readership, including biologists, microbiologists, geologists, water managers and environmental consultants. The book complements the highly successful The Molecular Biology of Cyanobacteria already published by Kluwer.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Since its original appearance in 1977, Advanced Organic Chemistry has found wide use as a text providing broad coverage of the structure, reactivity and synthesis of organic compounds. The Fourth Edition provides updated material but continues the essential elements of the previous edition. The material in Part A is organized on the basis of fundamental structural topics such as structure, stereochemistry, conformation and aromaticity and basic mechanistic types, including nucleophilic substitution, addition reactions, carbonyl chemistry, aromatic substitution and free radical reactions. The material in Part B is organized on the basis of reaction type with emphasis on reactions of importance in laboratory synthesis. As in the earlier editions, the text contains extensive references to both the primary and review literature and provides examples of data and reactions that illustrate and document the generalizations. While the text assumes completion of an introductory course in organic chemistry, it reviews the fundamental concepts for each topic that is discussed. The Fourth Edition updates certain topics that have advanced rapidly in the decade since the Third Edition was published, including computational chemistry, structural manifestations of aromaticity, enantioselective reactions and lanthanide catalysis. The two parts stand alone, although there is considerable cross-referencing. Part A emphasizes quantitative and qualitative description of structural effects on reactivity and mechanism. Part B emphasizes the most general and useful synthetic reactions. The focus is on the core of organic chemistry, but the information provided forms the foundation for future study and research in medicinal and pharmaceutical chemistry, biological chemistry and physical properties of organic compounds. The New Revised 5th Edition will be available shortly. For details, click on the link in the right-hand column.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">The fourth Chinese Peptide Symposium, hosted by Peking University, was held at Chengdu, China on July 21 25, 1996 with 164 participants, including 45 scientists from abroad, representing 12 countries. The four day conference was both intense and spiritually rewarding. Our goal for CPS 96 was to provide a forum for the exchange of knowledge, cooperation and friendship between the international and Chinese scientific communities, and we believe this goal was met. The symposium consisted of 10 sessions with 55 oral and 78 poster presentations, including synthetic methods, molecular diversity and peptide libraries, structure and conformation of peptides and proteins, bioactive peptides, peptide immunology, De Novo design and synthesis of proteins and peptides, ligand receptor interactions, the chemistry biology interface and challenging problems in peptides. Theenthusiasticcooperationandexcellentcontributionsweregratifying andtheactive response of the invited speakers contributed to the success of the symposium. The presentations were of excellent caliber and represented the most current and significant aspects of peptide science. Dr. James P. Tam and Dr. Jie Cheng Xu were the recipients of ‘The Cathay Award’ sponsored by the H. H. Liu Education Foundation, offered for their seminal contributions in peptide science and the Chinese Peptide Symposium. Four outstanding young scientists were selected by the organizing committee to receive awards sponsored by Haikou Nanhai Pharmaceutical Industry Co. Ltd. (Zhong He Group).</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Animal cell technology is becoming an increasingly important part of biotechnology and many products are now used in human health care and for veterinary applications. However, there are many times more products actually in the developmental pipelines of the biotechnology industry, including various phases of clinical trials. The Proceedings of the 15th Meeting of the European Society for Animal Cell Technology (Tours, France, September 1997) presents the actual current state as well as New Developments and Applications in Animal Cell Technology for the benefit of society. These Proceedings represent both the current state and applications of animal cell technology and the way the technology is expanding into new areas to give a unique insight into new products and applications for human and animal health care.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Continuous cell lines derived from human cancers are the mostwidely used resource in laboratory-based cancer research. The first 3 volumes of this series on Human Cell Culture are devoted to these cancer cell lines. The chapters in these first 3 volumes have a common aim. Their purpose is to address 3 questions offundamental importance to the relevanceof human cancer cell lines as model systems of each type of cancer: 1. Do the cell lines available accurately represent the clinical presentation? 2. Do the cell lines accurately represent the histopathology of the original tumors? 3. Do the cell lines accurately represent the molecular genetics of this type of cancer? The cancer cell lines available are derived, in most cases, from the more aggressive and advanced cancers. There are few cell lines derived from low grade organ-confined cancers. This gap can be filled with conditionally immortalized human cancer cell lines. We do not know why the success rate for establishing cell lines is so low for some types of cancer and so high for others. The histopathology of the tumor of origin and the extent to which the derived cell line retains the differentiated features of that tumor are critical. The concept that a single cell line derived from a tumor at a particular site is representative oftumors at that site is naïve and misleading.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">The Fifteen American Peptide Symposium (15APS) was held in Nashville, Tennessee, on June 14-19, 1997. This biennial meeting was jointly sponsored by the American Peptide Society and Vanderbilt University. The attendance of 1,081 participants from 37 countries was lower than the two previously held Symposia. However, the number of participating countries was the largest. Thus, it was gratifying to see that this meeting retained both its international flavor and participant loyalty at a time when there are many more symposia held each year on similar subjects. The scientific program, thanks to the insights and efforts of the Program Committee as well as Dr. Peter Schiller, the President of the American Peptide Society, was extraordinarily rich, diverse, and exciting. It was comprised of 124 oral and 550 poster presentations. Three prominent format changes were installed. First, the Symposium started on Saturday instead of Sunday. Second, the program opened on Saturday afternoon with a Mini-symposium by the Young Investigators to give them an early start and attention. Finally, 40 short and definitive reports were given in two parallel sessions. The expanded format permitted an unprecedented number of lectures and enabled wider participation by the attending delegates.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">claim was that he had faced a conflict of duties pitting his legal duty not to kill against his duty as a physician to relieve his patient’s unbearable suffering. He was acquitted on the important grounds of conflict of duty. These grounds are based on a concept in Dutch law called "force majeure" 4 which recognizes extenuating circumstances such as conflicts of duty. The acquittal was upheld by the Lower Court of Alkmaar, but revoked by an Amsterdam court of appeal. The case went on to the Supreme Court, but before the Supreme Court's decision was issued, the Royal Dutch Medical Association (RDMA) attempted to clarify the criteria for euthanasia that many within the profession already accepted. The RDMA proposed that physicians be permitted to perform euthanasia provided that a set of procedures had been met. Variously stated, the guidelines contain the following central provisions: Voluntary, competent, explicit, and persistent requests on the part of the • patient; Requests based on full information; • The patient is in a situation of intolerable and hopeless suffering (either • physical or mental); No further acceptable alternatives to euthanasia. All alternatives • acceptable to the patient for relief of suffering having been tried; Consultation with at least one other physician whose judgment can be • 5 expected to be independent. Indirectly, these guidelines became the criteria prosecutors used to decide whether or not to bring charges.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">In the late 1980s, Peptide Societies were established in Europe, the United States, and Japan, and more recently, in the Asian and the Pacific Rim regions including Australia, China, and Korea. At the time of the establishment of the American, European and Japanese Peptide Societies, the International Liaison Organizing Committee representing these Peptide Societies, along with the Australian Peptide Society, began discussions for holding international confer ences which would supercede or be held in lieu of the numerous individual meetings, held by the peptide societies of each individual country or region. The representative of the Chinese Peptide Society participated in these discus sion in the International Liaison Organizing Committee at the meeting of the American Peptide Symposium in Nashville, in June 1997. After lengthy discus sions over several years, we agreed to organize and host the International Peptide Symposium in Japan. The First International Peptide Symposium (IPS’97) was held on November 30–December 5, 1997, in Kyoto, and was co sponsored by four Peptide Societies. The attendance at this Symposium was 550 participants, including representatives from 32 different countries. We were very pleased with this outcome and anticipate an even larger attendance for forthcoming Symposia in future years. The revolution and advances in science and technology during the past two decades has caused traditional peptide chemistry to expand to peptide science, spreading from physical science to biology, pharmacology, and medicine.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Animal cell technology is a growing discipline of cell biology which aims not only to understand structures, functions and behaviors of differentiated animal cells but also to ascertain their abilities to be used for industrial and medical purposes. The goal of animal cell technology includes accomplishments of clonal expansion of differentiated cells with useful ability, optimization of their culture conditions, modulation of their ability for production of medically and pharmaceutically important proteins, and the application of animal cells to gene therapy and artificial organs. This Volume gives the readers a complete review of the present state of the art in Japan. The Proceedings will be useful for cell biologists, biochemists, molecular biologists, immunologists, biochemical engineers and other disciplines related to animal cell culture, working either in academic environments or in industries of biotechnology and pharmacy.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Debate regarding organ sales is largely innocent of the history of thought on the matter. This volume seeks to remedy this shortcoming. Positions for or against a market in human organs are nested within moral intuitions, ontological or political theoretical premises, or understandings of special moral concerns, such as permissible uses of the body, which have a long history of analysis. The essays compass the views of Plato, Aristotle, Aquinas, Locke, Kant, Hegel, Mill and Christianity, as well as particular methodological approaches, such as the phenomenology of the body, natural law theory, legal theory and libertarian critique of legal theory. These discussions cluster a number of conceptually independent philosophical concerns: (1) What is the appropriate understanding of the relationship between persons and their bodies? (2) What does it mean to `own' an organ? (3) Do governments have moral authority to regulate how persons use their own body parts? (4) What are the costs and benefits of a market in human organs? Such questions are related by an urgent public health challenge: the considerable disparity between the number of patients who could significantly benefit from organ transplantation and the number of human organs available for transplantation. This volume explores the theoretical, normative, and historical foundations for alternative policies for procurement and transplantation of human organs.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">This volume explores Confucian views regarding the human body, health, virtue, suffering, suicide, euthanasia, `human drugs,' human experimentation, and justice in health care distribution. These views are rooted in Confucian metaphysical, cosmological, and moral convictions, which stand in contrast to modern Western liberal perspectives in a number of important ways. In the contemporary world, a wide variety of different moral traditions flourish; there is real moral diversity. Given this circumstance, difficult and even painful ethical conflicts often occur between the East and the West with regard to the issues of life, birth, reproduction, and death. The essays in this volume analyze the ways in which Confucian bioethics can clarify important moral concepts, provide arguments, and offer ethical guidance. The volume should be of interest to both general readers coming afresh to the study of bioethics, ethics, and Confucianism, as well as for philosophers, ethicists, and other scholars already familiar with the subject.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">It is a truism of science that the more fundamental the subject, the more universally applicable it is. Nevertheless, it is important to strike a level of “fundamentalness” appropriate to the task in hand. For -depth study of the mechanics of motor cars would tell one example, an in nothing about the dynamics of traffic. Traffic exists on a different “level” - it is dependent upon the existence of motor vehicles but the physics and mathematics of traffic can be adequately addressed by considering motor vehicles as mobile “blobs”,with no consideration of how they become mobile. To start a discourse on traffic with a consideration of the mechanics of motor vehicles would thus be inappropropriate. In writing this volume, I have wrestled with the question of the appropriate level at which to address the physics underlying many of the techniques used in protein isolation. I have tried to strike a level as would be used by a mechanic (with perhaps a slight leaning towards an engineer) - i.e. a practical level, offering appropriate insight but with minimal mathematics. Some people involved in biochemical research have a minimal grounding in chemistry and physics and so I have tried to keep it as simple as possible.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Animal cell technology is a growing discipline of cell biology which aims not only to understand structures, functions and behaviors of differentiated animal cells but also to ascertain their abilities to be used in industrial and medical purposes. The goal of animal cell technology includes accomplishments of clonal expansion of differentiated cells with useful ability, optimization of their culture conditions, modulation of their ability to produce medically and pharmaceutically, important proteins, and the application of animal cells to gene therapy and artificial organs. This volume gives the readers a complete review of present state of the art in Japan. The Proceedings will be useful for cell biologists, biochemists, molecular biologists, immunologists, biochemical engineers and other disciplines related to animal cell culture, working in either academic environments or in biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">The human body contains many specialized tissues that are capable of fulfilling an incredible variety of functions necessary for our survival. This volume in the Human Cell Culture Series focuses on mesenchymal tissues and cells. The in vitro study of mesenchymal cells is perhaps the oldest form of human cell culture, beginning with the culturing of fibroblasts. Fibroblasts have long been generically described in the literature, arising from many tissue types upon in vitro cell culture. However, recent studies, many enabled by new molecular biology techniques, have shown considerable diversity in fibroblast type and function, as described within this volume. Mesenchymal tissue types that are described within include bone, cartilage, tendons and ligaments, muscle, adipose tissue, and skin (dermis). The proper function of these tissues is predominantly dependent upon the proper proliferation, differentiation, and function of the mesenchymal cells which make up the tissue. Recent advancements in primary human mesenchymal cell culture have led to remarkable progress in the study of these tissues. Landmark experiments have now demonstrated a stem cell basis for many of these tissues, and, furthermore, significant plasticity and inter-conversion of stem cells between these tissues, resulting in a great deal of contemporary excitement and controversy. Newly-developed mesenchymal cell culture techniques have even lead to novel clinical practices for the treatment of disease.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">K. Danner Clouser is one of the most important figures in establishing and shaping the fields of medical ethics, bioethics, and the philosophy of education in the second half of the twentieth century. Clouser challenged many established approaches to moral theory and offered innovative strategies for integrating the humanities into professional education, especially that of physicians and nurses. The contributions published in Building Bioethics: Conversations with Clouser and Friends on Medical Ethics are unique both in their devotion to a critical review of his contributions, and in bringing together internationally known figures in bioethics, medical ethics, and philosophy of medicine to comment upon Clouser's work. These leaders of the field include Tom Beauchamp, Daniel Callahan, James Childress, Nancy Dubler, H. Tristram Engelhardt, Al Jonsen, Loretta Kopelman, Larry McCullough, John Moskop, and Robert Veatch. This book merits special attention from those interested in bioethics, philosophy of medicine, medical ethics, philosophy, medical education, religious studies, and nursing education.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Continuous cell lines derived from human cancers are the most widely used resource in laboratory-based cancer research. The first 3 volumes of this series on Human Cell Culture are devoted to these cancer cell lines. The chapters in these first 3 volumes have a common aim. Their purpose is to address 3 questions of fundamental importance to the relevance of human cancer cell lines as model systems of each type of cancer: 1. Do the cell lines available accurately represent the clinical presentation? 2. Do the cell lines accurately represent the histopathology of the original tumors? 3. Do the cell lines accurately represent the molecular genetics of this type of cancer? The cancer cell lines available are derived, in most cases, from the more aggressive and advanced cancers. There are few cell lines derived from low grade organ-confined cancers. This gap can be filled with conditionally immortalized human cancer cell lines. We do not know why the success rate for establishing cell lines is so low for some types of cancer and so high for others. The histopathology of the tumor of origin and the extent to which the derived cell line retains the differentiated features of that tumor are critical. The concept that a single cell line derived from a tumor at a particular site is representative of tumors at that site is naïve and misleading.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">High-throughput screening and combinatorial chemistry are two of the most potent weapons ever to have been used in the discovery of new drugs. At a stroke, it seems to be possible to synthesise more molecules in a month than have previously been made in the whole of the distinguished history of organic chemistry, Furthermore, all the molecules can be screened in the same short period. However, like any weapons of immense power, these techniques must be used with care, to achieve maximum impact. The costs of implementing and running high-throughput screening and combinatorial chemistry are high, as large dedicated facilities must be built and staffed. In addition, the sheer number of chemical leads generated may overwhelm the lead optimisation teams in a hail of friendly fire. Mother nature has not entirely surrendered, as the number of building blocks that could be used to build libraries would require more atoms than there are in the universe. In addition, the progress made by the Human Genome Project has uncovered many proteins with different functions but related binding sites, creating issues of selectivity. Advances in the new field of pharmacogenomics will produce more of these challenges. There is a real need to make hi- throughput screening and combinatorial chemistry into 'smart' weapons, so that their power is not dissipated. That is the challenge for modellers, computational chemists, cheminformaticians and IT experts. In this book, we have broken down this grand challenge into key tasks.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">The germs of the ideas in this book became implanted in me during my experience as a resident in clinical pathology at Boston University Medical Center. At the time, I had inklings that the test results churned out by our laboratories were more than scientific facts. As a philosophically unsophisticated young physician, however, I had no language or framework to analyze what I saw as a deep philosophical problem, a problem largely unrecognized by most physicians. The test results provided by our laboratories were accurate and of great practical importance for patient care. However, most of the physicians who relied on our test results to diagnose and treat their patients either did not have the time or interest to consider the philosophical issues inherent in diagnosis, or, like me, had inadequate means to further analyze them. It was more than ten years later that I began doctoral studies in philosophy, and I was fortunate to find a faculty that was supportive ofmy efforts to address the problem. This book began as my doctoral dissertation in the Department of Philosophy at Georgetown University. I would like to acknowledge the assistance of my mentor, Robert Veatch, Ph. D. Our conversations during my Georgetown years led me in new and often fascinating directions. I would also like to acknowledge the help of Kenneth Schaffner, M. D. , Ph. D.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">During the last 10 years, there has been a `revolution' in ecosystem modelling. The generality and predictive power of our models have increased in a way that was inconceivable 10 years ago. This book describes a new generation of practically useful models that predict as well as one can measure - if one measures well. And yet, they are driven by readily available driving variables and have a general structure that applies to most types of pollutants in aquatic systems. The major reason for this development is, in fact, the Chernobyl accident. Large quantities of radiocesium were released in April/May 1986 as a pulse. To follow the pulse of radiocesium through ecosystem pathways has meant that important fluxes and mechanisms, i.e., ecosystem structures, have been revealed. It is important to stress that many of these new structures and equations are valid not just for radiocesium, but for most types of contaminants, e.g. for metals, nutrients and organics. This means that the models, methods (of building and testing models) and equations described in this book for lakes and coastal areas should be of great interest also to other ecosystem modellers. This book will be of considerable interest to: students in radioecology, geosciences and biology; environmental engineers; consultants; administrators and scientists interested in the spread, biouptake and ecosystem effects of chemical pollutants in aquatic ecosystems.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">of UB’s medical school, that UB developed its School of Arts and Sciences, and thus, assumed its place among the other institutions of higher education. Had Fillmore lived throughout UB’s first seventy years, he would probably have been elated by the success of his university, and he should have been satisfied and pleased that UB remained intrinsically bonded to its community while at the same time engrafting the values and standards important to higher education’s mission in the region. UB and its medical school have undergone many challenging transitions since 1846. Included among them were: (1) the completion of an academic campus in the far northeast comer of the City of Buffalo while leaving its medical, dental and law schools firmly situated in the core of downtown Buffalo; (2) the eventual relocation, after the second world war, of the law school to the newer campus in Amherst, and the medical and dental school to the original academic campus: and (3) the merger with the State University of New York System in 1962. Despite these significant transitions, any one of which could have changed the intrinsic integrity of UB and disrupted the bonding between community and university, that did not happen. To this day, the ties between community and academe persist. Fillmore and White should celebrate their success and important contribution to Buffalo and Western New York.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">The Fifth Chinese Peptide Symposium, hosted by Lanzhou University, was held at Lanzhou, China July 14-17, 1998, with 156 participants, including 30 scientists from abroad, representing nine countries. The four-day conference was both intense and spiritually rewarding. Our goal for CPS-98 was to provide a forum for the exchange of knowledge, cooperation and friendship between the international and Chinese scientific communities, and we believe this goal was met. The symposium consisted of 8 sessions with 42 oral and 90 poster presentations, including synthetic methods, molecular diversity and peptide libraries, structure and conformation of peptides and proteins, bioactive peptides, peptide immunology, De Novo design and synthesis of proteins and peptides, ligand-receptor interactions, the chemistry-biology-interface and challenging problems in peptides. The enthusiastic cooperation and excellent contributions were gratifying and the active response of the invited speakers contributed to the success of the symposium. The presentations were of excellent caliber and represented the most current and significant aspects of peptide science. Dr. Kit Lam of the University of Arizona and Dr. Yun-Hua Ye of Peking University were the recipients of “The Cathay Award” sponsored by the H. H. Liu Education Foundation, offered for their seminal contribution in peptide science and the Chinese Peptide Symposium. Four outstanding young scientists were selected by the organizing committee to receive awards sponsored by Haikou Nanhai Pharmaceutical Industry Co. Ltd. (Zhong He Group).</dcvalue>

For labor and lactation oxytocin you must buy! Enkephalin always gives a good runner’s high! So won’t you try peptides? Small proteins, the best in the land!” The above words [1], penned by Gary Gisselman to open Peptide Ångst: La Triviata, the opera which made its world premiere on July 1, 1999, also serve as a fitting charge to the th 16 American Peptide Symposium. This latest edition of a premier biennial series was held under the auspices of the American Peptide Society, June 26–July 1, 1999, at the Minneapolis Convention Center, Minneapolis,Minnesota, with the undersigned serving as Co-Chairs. The fortunate coincidence of the calendar allowed us to set as the theme “Peptides for the New Millennium”, and in our judgment, the approximately 1200 participants [2] who converged in the Twin Cities from academic and industrial institutions in 36 countries were treated to an exciting and stimulating conference that left most everyone with an enthusiastic vision for the future of our field. The present Proceedings volume should serve as a handy reference source and succinct snapshot of peptide science at essentially its century mark – the clock having started with the initial contributions of Emil Fischer and Th.

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Beyond Brain Death offers a provocative challenge to one of the most widely accepted conclusions of contemporary bioethics: the position that brain death marks the death of the human person. Eleven chapters by physicians, philosophers, and theologians present the case against brain-based criteria for human death. Each author believes that this position calls into question the moral acceptability of the transplantation of unpaired vital organs from brain-dead patients who have continuing function of the circulatory system. One strength of the book is its international approach to the question: contributors are from the United States, the United Kingdom, Liechtenstein, and Japan. This book will appeal to a wide audience, including physicians and other health care professionals, philosophers, theologians, medical sociologists, and social workers.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">In the next couple of years the human genome will be fully sequenced. This will provide us with the sequence and overall function of all human genes as well as the complete genome for many micro-organisms. Subsequently it is hoped, by means of powerful bioinformatic tools, to determine the gene variants that contribute to various multifactorial diseases and genes that exist in certain infectious agents but not humans. As a consequence, this will allow us to define the most appropriate levels for drug intervention. It can be expected that the number of potential drug targets will increase, possibly by a factor of 10 or more. Nevertheless, sequencing the human genome or, for that matter, the genome of other species will only be the starting point for the understanding of their biological function. Structural genomics is a likely follow-up, combined with new techniques to validate the therapeutic relevance of such newly discovered targets. Accordingly, it can be expected that in the near future we will witness a substantial increase in novel putative targets for drugs. To address these new targets effectively, we require new approaches and innovative tools. At present, two alternative, yet complementary, techniques are employed: experimental high-throughput screening (HTS) of large compound libraries, increasingly provided by combinatorial chemistry, and computational methods for virtual screening and de novo design. As kind of status report on the maturity of virtual screening as a technique in drug design, the first workshop on new approaches in drug design and discovery was held in March 1999, at Schloß Rauischholzhausen, near Marburg in Germany. More than 80 scientists gathered and discussed their experience with the different techniques. The speakers were invited to summarize their contributions together with their impressions on the present applicability of their approach. Several of the speakers followed this request which is summarized in this publication.</dcvalue>

Professor Lesley J. Rogers, Chapter 1 of Side Bias: A Neuropsychological Perspective. This volume contains 14 chapters from a veritable `United Nations' of experts in the field of lateralization of function. They write comprehensive reviews, present data, and pose new questions concerning the evolutionary origins and development of side bias, methodological concerns with the way we measure handedness and footedness, and some more unusual aspects of human beings' lateralized behavior, such as asymmetrical cradling and pseudoneglect. The book will be essential reading for students of behavioral neuroscience and neuropsychology interested in lateralization of function as well as for established researchers in the field.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">The present book entitled “Novel Frontiers in the Production of Compounds for Biomedical Uses” can perhaps be placed in its best perspective by the Shakespearean character in The Tempest who exclaimed" What’s past is prologue”. Indeed, this compilation of some of the outstanding presentations in the field of biomedicine made at th the 9 European Congress on Biotechnology (Brussels, Belgium, July 11-15, 1999) not only reflects the achievements of the recent past, but provides a privileged glimpse of the biotechnology that is emerging in the first decade of the new Millennium. It is becoming increasingly apparent that biotechnology is offering biomedicine novel approaches and solutions to develop a sorely needed new generation of biopharmaceuticals. This is all the more necessary because in recent years, new diseases have emerged with extraordinary lethality in all corners of the globe, while age-related chronic illnesses have filled the gap wherever biomedicine has made successful inroads. The rise of antibiotic resistance also poses major threats to public health. Thus, as disease patterns evolve, the rational development of new drugs is becoming urgent, not only for the clinical outcome of patients, but also in optimising the allocation of scarce health care resources through the use of cost-effective productions methods. It is in response to all these challenges that biotechnology offers new strategies that go beyond the more traditional approaches. By the mid-1990’s, the number of recombinant products approved annually for therapeutic use reached double digits. With the advent of the genomics revolution.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">The daily production of hundreds of billions of blood cells through the process of hematopoiesis is a remarkable feat of human physiology. Transport of oxygen to tissues, blood clotting, antibody- and cellular-mediated immunity, bone remodeling, and a host of other functions in the body are dependent on a properly functioning hematopoietic system. As a consequence, many pathological conditions are attributable to blood cell abnormalities, and a fair number of these are now clinically treatable as a direct result of hematopoietic research. Proliferation of hematopoietic stem cells, and their differentiation into the many different lineages of functional mature cells, is highly regulated and responsive to many environmental and physiological challenges. Our relatively advanced understanding of this stem cell system provides potentially important insights into the regulation of development in other tissues, many of which are now being acknowledged as stem ce- based, perhaps even into adulthood. The recent public and scientific fanfare following announcement of human embryonic stem cell studies suggests that stem cell research will continue to be a relevant and exciting topic.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Animal biotechnology is a broad umbrella encompassing the polarities of fundamental and applied research including molecular modelling, molecular and quantitative genetics, gene manipulation, development of diagnostics and vaccines and manipulation of tissue or digestion metabolism by growth promoters. Although animal biotechnology in the broadest sense is not new, what is new is the level of complexity and precision involved in scientists' current ability to manipulate living organisms. This new book sets out to show that the important ideas in animal biotechnology are exciting and relevant to everyday experience. It represents an important update of the literature for research workers, lecturers, and advisers in animal science, but is also a core text for advanced undergraduate courses in animal science and biotechnology. It will be an essential acquisition for librarians in agriculture and veterinary science.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">This book illustrates the major trends in applied microbiology research with immediate or potential industrial applications. The papers proposed reflect the diversity of the application fields. New microbial developments have been done as well in the food and health sectors than in the environmental technology or in the fine chemical production. All the microbial genera are involved : yeast, fungi and bacteria. The development of biotechnology in parallel with the industrial microbiology has enabled the application of microbial diversity to our socio-economical world. The remarkable properties of microbes, inherent in their genetic and enzymatic material, allow a wide range of applications that can improve our every day life. Recent studies for elucidating the molecular basis of the physiological processes in micro-organisms are essential to improve and to control the metabolic pathways to overproduce metabolites or enzymes of industrial interest. The genetic engineering is of course one of the disciplines offering new horizons for the « fantastic microbial factory » . Studies of the culture parameter incidence on the physiology and the morphology are essential to control the response of the micro-organisms before its successful exploitation at the industrial scale. For this purpose, fundamental viewpoints are necessary. Development of novel approaches to characterise micro-organisms would also facilitate the understanding of the inherent metabolic diversity of the microbial world, in terms of adaptation to a wide range of biotopes and establishment of microbial consortia.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Early integration is the key to success in industrial biotechnology. This is as true when a selected wild-type organism is put to work as when an organism is engineered for a purpose. The present volume Engineering and Manufacturing for Biotechnology took advantage of the 9th European Congress on Biotechnology (Brussels, Belgium, July 11-15, 1999): in the topics handled and in the expertise of the contributors, the engineering science symposia of this congress offered just what was needed to cover the important topic of integration of process engineering and biological research. The editors have solicited a number of outstanding contributions to illustrate the intimate interaction between productive organisms and the numerous processing steps running from the initial inoculation to the packaged product. Upstream processing of the feed streams, selection of medium components, product harvesting, downstream processing, and product conditioning are just a few major steps. Each step imposes a number of important choices. Every choice is to be balanced against time to market, profitability, safety, and ecology.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">One ofthe major drivers in biological research is the establishment ofstructures and functions of the 50,000 or so proteins in our bodies. Each has a characteristic- dimensional structure, highly "ordered" yet "disordered"! This structure is essential for a protein's function and, significantly, it must be sustained in the competitive and complex environment of the living cell. It is now being recognised that when a cell loses control, proteins can se- assemble into more complex supermolecular structures such as the amyloid fibres and plaques associated with the pathogenesis of prion (CJD) or age-related (Alzheimer's) diseases. This is a pointer to the wider significance of the self-assembling properties of polypeptides. It has been long known that, in silk, polypeptides are assembled into- sheet structures which impart on the material its highly exploitable properties of flexibility combined with high tensile strength. But only now emerging is the recognition that peptides can Self-assemble into a wide variety of non-protein-like structures, including fibrils, fibres, tubules, sheets and monolayers. These are exciting observations and, more so, the potential for materials and medical exploitations is so wide ranging that over 80 scientists from Europe, USA, Japan and Israel. met 1-6 July 1999 in Crete, to discuss the wide-ranging implications of these novel developments. There was a spirit of excitement about the workshop indicative of an important new endeavor. The emerging perception is that of a new class of materials set to become commercially viable early in the 21st century.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">At the end of the 20th century, a tremendous progress was made in biotechnology in its widest sense. This progress was largely possible as a result of joint efforts of top academic researchers in both pure fundamental sciences and applied research. The surplus value of such interdisciplinary approaches was clearly highlighted during the 9th European Congress on Biotechnology that was held in Brussels, Belgium (11-15 July, 1999). The present volume in the ‘Focus on Biotechnology’ series, entiteld ‘Physics and Chemistry Basis for Biotechnology’ contains selected presentations from this meeting, A collection of experts has made serious efforts to present some of the latest developments in various scientific fields and to unveil prospective evolutions on the threshold of the new millenium. In all contributions the emphasis is on emerging new areas of research in which physicochemical principles form the foundation. In reading the different chapters, it appears that more than ever significant advances in biotechnology very often depend on breakthroughs in the biotechnology itself (e.g.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Analytical Molecular Biology illustrates the importance of simple analytical methods applied to some basic molecular biology problems, with an emphasis on the importance of biological problems, rather than the complexity of mathematics. First, the book examines crucial experimental data for a specific problem. Mathematical models will then be constructed with explicit inclusion of biological facts. From such models, predictions can be deduced and then suggest further experimental studies. A few important molecular biology problems will be discussed in the order of the complexity of the mathematical models. Based on such illustrations, the readers can then develop their own analytical methods to study their own problems. This book is for anyone who knows they need to learn how to apply mathematical models to biology, but doesn't necessarily want to, from practicing researchers looking to acquire more analytical tools to advanced students seeking a clear, explanatory text.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">African trypanosomes are tsetse-transmitted protozoa that inhabit the extracellular compartment of host blood. They cause fatal sleeping sickness in people, and Nagana, a wasting and generally fatal disease, in cattle. While trypanosomes are most common to Africa (about 30% of Africa's cattle graze on the fringe of the tsetse habitat), some species have spread beyond its boarders to Asia, the Middle East and South America. The African Trypanosomes, volume one of World Class Parasites, is written for researchers, students and scholars who enjoy reading research that has a major impact on human health, or agricultural productivity, and against which we have no satisfactory defense. It is intended to supplement more formal texts that cover taxonomy, life cycles, morphology, vector distribution, symptoms and treatment. It integrates vector, pathogen and host biology and celebrates the diversity of approach that comprises modern parasitological research.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Proteomics is an introduction to the exciting new field of proteomics, an interdisciplinary science that includes biology, bioinformatics, and protein chemistry. The purpose of this book is to provide the active researcher with an overview of the types of questions being addressed in proteomics studies and the technologies used to address those questions. Key subjects covered in this book include: an assessment of the limitations of this approach and outlines new developments in mass spectrometry that will advance future research high-throughput recombinant DNA cloning methods used to systematically clone all of the open reading frames of an organism into plasmid vectors for large scale protein expression and functional studies such as protein-protein interactions with the two-hybrid system protein structure an overview of large-scale experimental attempts to determine the three-dimensional structures of representative sets of proteins computational approaches to determining the three-dimensional structure of proteins. Proteomics provides a starting point for researchers who would like a theoretical understanding of the new technologies in the field, and obtain a solid grasp of the fundamentals before integrating new tools into their experiments. Written with attention to detail, but without being overwhelmingly technical, Proteomics is a user-friendly guide needed by most biologists today.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Classical conditioning of the nictitating membrane (NM) eyeblink response in rabbits is a useful model system for the study of the neurobiology of learning and memory. This paradigm that is so well described on a biological level has also been applied to studies of normal development over the life span and to instances of abnormal developmental phenomena. Eyeblink conditioning has been studied from molecular and neural network perspectives, and the paradigm is of demonstrated utility in elucidating mechanisms in physiology and pharmacology. This model system provides a behavioral paradigm in animals that has a close analog in human behavior. Perspectives of recent developments in human eyeblink classical conditioning research are presented in the companion volume to this book, Eyeblink Classical Conditioning: Applications in Humans.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">This volume has been composed as an appreciation of Martin L. Albert in the year of his 60th birthday. At least one contributor to each paper in this volume has been touched by Marty in some way; lie has mentored some, been a fellow student with some, and been a colleague to most. These contributors, as well as many others, view Marty as a gifted scientist and a wonderful human being. The breadth of his interests and intellectual pursuits is truly impressive; this breadth is reflected, only in part. by the diversity of the papers in this volume. His interests have ranged from psychopharmacology to cross-cultural understanding of dementia, through the aphasias, to the history of the fields that touch on behavioral neurology, especially neurology per se, cognitive psychology, speech-language pathology, and linguistics. Throughout his scholarly work, Martha Taylor Sarno notes, Marty never loses the human perspective, e. g. , the “powerfully disabling effect on the individual person” with aphasia or other neurological disorder. For those readers who only how a portion of his work, we thought that we should describe him here. Many of the people whom Marty has influenced have been able to contribute to this volume. We have invited some others who were unable to contribute to express their appreciation for him, as well.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Computational and Evolutionary Analysis of HIV Molecular Sequences is for all researchers interested in HIV research, even those who only have a nodding acquaintance with computational biology (or those who are familiar with some, but not all, aspects of the field). HIV research is unusual in that it brings together scientists from a wide range of disciplines: clinicians, pathologists, immunologists, epidemiologists, virologists, computational biologists, structural biologists, evolutionary biologists, statisticians and mathematicians. This book seeks to bridge the gap between these groups, in both subject matter and terminology. Focused largely on HIV genetic variation, Computational and Evolutionary Analysis of HIV Molecular Sequences covers such issues as sampling and processing sequences, population genetics, phylogenetics and drug targets.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">From the time questions about the impact of wireless technology on public health were first raised in 1993 through the present, Wireless Technology Research, LLC (WTR) has been the largest independent surveillance and research program trying to identify and solve human health problems associated with wireless phones. In 1995 at the University “La Sapienza” of Rome, WTR sponsored the first comprehensive forum for the discussion of these issues. Papers from the 1995 State of the Science Colloquium were collected andpublished in Volume I ofthis series, Wireless Phones andHealth: Scientific Progress. This second volume assembles papers presented at WTR’s Second State of the Science Colloquium in Long Beach, CA, in June 1999; it contains the most comprehensive research on the public health impact of wireless phones to date. The operating words for the proper understanding of these data are science and public health. Science is a tool for making public health decisions, but the framework in which we are operating is truly that of public health. We are looking for problems that have to do with wireless technology. We are trying to decide how this technology impacts on the public for one purpose and one purpose alone, and that purpose is to solve problems that are identified. I would like to challenge you, the reader, to suspend your parochial orientation as you consider these latest findings.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Susan Kemper A debate about the role of working memory in language processing has become center-most in psycholinguistics (Caplan &amp; Waters, in press; Just &amp; Carpenter, 1992; Just, Carpenter, &amp; Keller, 1996; Waters &amp; Caplan, 1996). This debate concerns which aspects of language processing are vulnerable to working memory limitations, how working memory is best measured, and whether compensatory processes can offset working memory limitations. Age-comparative studies are particularly relevant to this debate for several reasons: difficulties with language and communication are frequently mentioned by older adults and signal the onset of Alzheimer's dementia and other pathologies associated with age; older adults commonly experience working memory limitations that affect their ability to perform everyday activities; the rapid aging of the United States population has forced psychologists and gerontologists to examine the effects of aging on cognition, drawing many investigators to the study of cognitive aging. Older adults constitute ideal population for studying how working memory limitations affect cognitive performance, particularly language and communication. Age-comparative studies of cognitive processes have advanced our understanding of the temporal dynamics of cognition as well as the working memory demands of many types of tasks (Kliegl, Mayr, &amp; Krampe, 1994; Mayr &amp; Kliegl, 1993). The research findings reviewed in this volume have clear implications - for addressing the practical problems of older adults as consumers of leisure ti- reading, radio and television broadcasts, as targets of medical, legal, and financial documents, and as participants in a web of service agencies and volunteer activities.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Combinatorial chemistry and molecular diversity approaches to scientific inquiry and novel product R&amp;D have exploded in the 1990s! For example, in the preparation of drug candidates, the automated, permutational, and combinatorial use of chemical building blocks now allows the generation and screening of unprecedented numbers of compounds. Drug discovery - better, faster, cheaper? Indeed, more compounds have been made and screened in the 1990s than in the last hundred years of pharmaceutical research. This first volume covers: (i) combinatorial chemistry, (ii) combinatorial biology and evolution, and (iii) informatics and related topics. Within each section chapters are prepared by experts in the field, including, for example, in Section I: Coverage of mixture pools vs. parallel individual compound synthesis, solution vs. solid-phase synthesis, analytical tools, and automation. Section II highlights selection strategies and library-based evolution, phage display, peptide and nucleic acid libraries. Section III covers databases and library design, high through-put screening, coding strategies vs. deconvolutions, intellectual property issues, deals and collaborations, and successes to date.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Lead-based paint has become a national issue and will continue to be a hi- priority focus ofnational, state, and local agencies until there is no lead-based paint in the United States. Lead-based paint has become a tremendous health hazard for people and animals. Lead-based paint has been in widespread use throughout Europe and the United States. Lead has been known to be a health hazard since the time ofPliny the Elder (A. D. 23–79), but it was deemed that the advantages of lead in paint outweighed the health hazards. There has been a change in outlook, and in 1973 the U. S. Congress banned all lead paint from residential structures. A voluminous number of law suits have been initiated since, and continue to be litigated with the purpose of determining the parties responsible for the lead poisoning of children and others and to exact the indemnities. Lead-based paint is still authorized for use on bridges and nonresidential structures, and thousands of city, state, military, and federal government housing projects still contain lead-based paint. This paint must be removed if these dwellings are to be safe living quarters, especially for children. Aba- ment techniques continue to be evaluated; some have been used successfully. Lead-based paint abatement will continue into the next century, and it is hoped that this comprehensive volume will serve as a guide for those seriously interested in this important subject.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Even high-speed supercomputers cannot easily convert traditional two-dimensional databases from chemical topology into the three-dimensional ones demanded by today's chemists, particularly those working in drug design. This fascinating volume resolves this problem by positing mathematical and topological models which greatly expand the capabilities of chemical graph theory. The authors examine QSAR and molecular similarity studies, the relationship between the sequence of amino acids and the less familiar secondary and tertiary protein structures, and new topological methods.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">This book had its nucleus in some lectures given by one of us (J. O’M. B. ) in a course on electrochemistry to students of energy conversion at the University of Pennsyl- nia. It was there that he met a number of people trained in chemistry, physics, biology, metallurgy, and materials science, all of whom wanted to know something about electrochemistry. The concept of writing a book about electrochemistry which could be understood by people with very varied backgrounds was thereby engendered. The lectures were recorded and written up by Dr. Klaus Muller as a 293-page manuscript. At a later stage, A. K. N. R. joined the effort; it was decided to make a fresh start and to write a much more comprehensive text. Of methods for direct energy conversion, the electrochemical one is the most advanced and seems the most likely to become of considerable practical importance. Thus, conversion to electrochemically powered transportation systems appears to be an important step by means of which the difficulties of air pollution and the effects of an increasing concentration in the atmosphere of carbon dioxide may be met. Cor- sion is recognized as having an electrochemical basis. The synthesis of nylon now contains an important electrochemical stage. Some central biological mechanisms have been shown to take place by means of electrochemical reactions. A number of American organizations have recently recommended greatly increased activity in training and research in electrochemistry at universities in the United States.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Prof. Jerzy Sobkowski starts off this 31st volume of Modern Aspects of Electrochemistry with a far-ranging discussion of experimental results from the past 10 years of interfacial studies. It forms a good background for the two succeeding chapters. The second chapter is by S. U. M. Khan on quantum mechanical treatment of electrode processes. Dr. Khan’s experience in this area is a good basis for this chapter, the contents of which will surprise some, but which as been well refereed. Molecular dynamic simulation is now a much-used technique in physical electrochemistry and in the third chapter Ilan Benjamin has written an account that brings together information from many recent publications, sometimes confirming earlier modeling approaches and sometimes breaking new territory. In Chapter 4, Akiko Aramata’s experience in researching single crystals is put to good advantage in her authoritative article on under- tential deposition. Finally, in Chapter 5, the applied side of electrochemistry is served by Bech-Neilsen et al. in the review of recent techniques for automated measurement of corrosion. J. O’M.

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Experiments showing a rapid and reversible change of color seem to be magic and are always fascinating. This process called photochromism, has a few real and many potential applications. Photochromic glasses that darken in the sunlight (protecting eyes from excessive light intensity) and bleach in dim light are today a part of everyday life. Organic Photochromic Compounds in plastic ophthalmic lenses, more comfortable to wear, are now competing with silver salts glasses, despite the longer lifetime of the inorganic system. This successful commercial application has given a new impetus to research in the general field of photochromism that had its most recent revival in the early eighties. The story of organic photochromism with its ups and downs, from the breakthroughs of the pioneering period in the fifties, through the hard times due to the drawbacks of photodegradation and the recent successes is in many ways a saga. The upsurges in the domain were marked by an increasing flow of articles in scientific journals and the publication of several Books (in 1971, 1990 and 1992) which have collected the important accumulated knowledge. Over this period, a considerable number of patents have been issued. International meetings have accompanied this activity, the most recent being held in 1993 (ISOP 93 at Les Embiez Island, France) and in 1996 (ISOP 96 in Clearwater, Florida, USA). Remarkably, these meetings had a good representation from both academia and industry. The next ISOP is planned for 1999 in Fukuoka, Japan.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">With the development in the 1960s of ultrahigh vacuum equipment and techniques and electron, X-ray, and ion beam techniques to determine the structure and composition of interfaces, activities in the field of surface science grew nearly exponentially. Today surface science impacts all major fields of study from physical to biological sciences, from physics to chemistry, and all engineering disciplines. The materials and phenomena characterized by surface science range from se- conductors, where the impact of surface science has been critical to progress, to metals and ceramics, where selected contributions have been important, to bio- terials, where contributions are just beginning to impact the field, to textiles, where the impact has been marginal. With such a range of fields and applications, questions about sample selection, preparation, treatment, and handling are difficult to cover completely in one review article or one chapter. Therefore, the editors of this book have assembled a range of experts with experience in the major fields impacted by surface characterization. It is the only book which treats the subject of sample handling, preparation, and treatment for surface characterization. It is full of tricks, cautions, and handy tips to make the laboratory scientist’s life easier. With respect to organization of the book, the topics range from discussion of vacuum to discussion of biological, organic, elemental or compound samples, to samples prepared ex situ or in situ to the vacuum, to deposition ofthin films. Generic considerations of sample preparation are also given.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Many books are available that detail the basic principles of the different methods of surface characterization. On the other hand, the scientific literature provides a resource of how individual pieces of research are conducted by particular labo- tories. Between these two extremes the literature is thin but it is here that the present volume comfortably sits. Both the newcomer and the more mature scientist will find in these chapters a wealth of detail as well as advice and general guidance of the principal phenomena relevant to the study of real samples. In the analysis of samples, practical analysts have fairly simple models of how everything works. Superimposed on this ideal world is an understanding of how the parameters of the measurement method, the instrumentation, and the char- teristics of the sample distort this ideal world into something less precise, less controlled, and less understood. The guidance given in these chapters allows the scientist to understand how to obtain the most precise and understood measu- ments that are currently possible and, where there are inevitable problems, to have clear guidance as the extent of the problem and its likely behavior.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">This volume contains a series of papers originally presented at the symposium on Water Soluble Polymers: Solution Properties and Applications, sponsored by the Division of Colloids and Surface Chemistry of the American Chemical Society. The symposium took place in Las Vegas City, Nevada on 9 to 11th September, 1997 at the 214th American Chemical Society National Meeting. Recognized experts in their - spective fields were invited to speak. There was a strong attendance from academia, g- ernment, and industrial research centers. The purpose of the symposium was to present and discuss recent developments in the solution properties of water soluble polymers and their applications in aqueous systems. Water soluble polymers find applications in a number of fields of which the following may be worth mentioning: cosmetics, detergent, oral care, industrial water treatment, g- thermal, wastewater treatment, water purification and reuse, pulp and paper production, sugar refining, and many more. Moreover, water soluble polymers play vital role in the oil industry, especially in enhanced oil recovery. Water soluble polymers are also used in ag- culture and controlled release pharmaceutical applications. Therefore, a fundamental kno- edge of solution properties of these polymers is essential for most industrial scientists. An understanding of the basic phenomena involved in the application of these polymers, such as adsorption and interaction with different substrates (i. e. , tooth enamel, hair, reverse - mosis membrane, heat exchanger surfaces, etc. ) is of vital importance in developing high performance formulations for achieving optimum efficiency of the system.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">This book contains papers presented at the Engineering Foundation Conference on mineral matter in fuels held on November 2-7, 1997 in Kona, Hawaii. The conference is one of a continuing series that was initiated by the CEGB Mar- wood Engineering Laboratories in 1963. The conference was to be eventually organised by the Engineering Foundation as the need for multi-disciplinary work related to c- trolling ash effects in combustors became apparent. The conference covers both the science and the applications. The papers also present case histories, particularly for current fuel technologies, developments in advanced technologies for power generation and mathematical modelling of these processes. Developments since 1963 have been slow, but steady, due to the complexity of the chemical and physical processes involved. However, the research presented here displays great improvement in our understanding of the mechanisms by which mineral matter will influence fuel use. Steve Benson from EERC presented a review and current status of issues related to ash deposition in coal combustion and gasification. The application of new analytical tools, which have been detailed in the previous conferences, is presented. These include CCSEM, as well as new techniques for char- terising sintering of ash, such as TMA, image analysis, X-ray diffraction crystallography and thermal analysis. The new analytical techniques were extended to encompass widely differing fuels such as biomass. Ole H Larsen from ELSAM Denmark presented a review of these advanced techniques.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Several long-term trends in technology evolution have become apparent since these symposia began in 1989. Earlier presenters more frequently discussed treatment methods involving harsh and extensive human intervention. As the symposia have continued, the number of presentations describing extremely harsh and expensive treatment technologies have gradually been supplanted by more subtle and gentler methods. Such methods include subsurface-engineered barriers, phytoremediation, and bioremediation. Nineteen manuscripts were selected for inclusion in this volume, based upon peer review, scientific merit, the editors' perceptions of lasting value or innovative features, and the general applicability of either the technology itself or the scientific methods and scholarly details provided by the authors. General topics include: soil treatment, groundwater treatment, and radioactive waste treatment.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">In the future, our energy systems will need to be renewable and sustainable, efficient and cost-effective, convenient and safe. Hydrogen has been proposed as the perfect fuel for this future energy system. The availability of a reliable and cost-effective supply, safe and efficient storage, and convenient end use of hydrogen will be essential for a transition to a Hydrogen Economy. Research is being conducted throughout the world for the development of safe, cost-effective hydrogen production, storage, and end-use technologies that support and foster this transition. This book is a collection of important research and analysis papers on hydrogen production, storage, and end-use technologies that were presented at the American Chemical Society National Meeting in New Orleans, Louisiana, USA, in August 1999.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectroscopy - also sometimes termed Electron Spin Resonance spectroscopy - has manifold potential uses in biochemistry and medicine. The paramount importance of EPR spectroscopy applied to biological tissues and fluids is that it identifies the changes in redox processes that contribute to disease. EPR spectroscopy has come a long way from its original use to detect malignant tumors. For example, the development and later refinement of methods of low-temperature registration of biological tissues widened the scope of EPR spectroscopy. Innovations made possible by the introduction of spin labels, probes, and traps made EPR spectroscopy ever more applicable to biochemistry and medicine, to the point where in vivo studies are being carefully considered. This comprehensive book discusses spectra of many tissues and bodily fluids, and the quantitative nature of paramagnetic centers in both normal individuals and patients suffering from a variety of diseases. Special attention is given to the EPR examination of bio-molecules, such as enzymes, polypeptides, vitamins, lipids, hydrocarbons, etc., which play an essential role in human activity. This book will be of great interest to physicians specializing in many different areas. Similarly, biologists, biochemists, biophysicists, and chemists will find this book very useful. It has also been written so that it may be used as a textbook at graduate level.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">As we transition into the 21st century, it is apparent that this is an exciting time for environmental engineers and scientists studying remediation technologies. There has been a rapid development of new ways to clean-up polluted groundwater. Research activities of the past and next 10 years will have a dramatic impact on the quality of the subsurface environment for the next century. In 20, or even 10 years from now, our approach to subsurface remediation will probably be vastly different than it is today. Many of the emerging technologies presented in this book will form the basis of standard remediation practices of the future. Physicochemical Groundwater Remediation presents detailed information on multiple emerging technologies for the remediation of the contaminated subsurface environment. All of these technologies apply our knowledge of physical and chemical processes to clean up ground water and the unsaturated zone, and many (if not all) of these emerging technologies will help define standard practices in the future. These technologies include in situ sorptive and reactive treatment walls, surfactant-enhanced aquifer remediation, optimization analyses for remediation system design, chemical, electrochemical, and biochemical remediation processes, and monitored natural attenuation. You will learn how palladium catalyzes the dehalogenation of chlorinated solvents. You will find out how barometric pumping can naturally remove significant quantities of volatile organic pollutants from shallow ground water and the unsaturated zone. You can learn about mobilizing non-aqueous phase liquids (NAPLs) without risking significant downward migration of the NAPL. You can find out how processes such as electroosmosis and electromigration can be exploited for groundwater remediation purposes and how zero-valent iron and zeolite treatment walls can be used in situ to treat and control contaminant plume migration. Contributors to this book are experts in groundwater remediation processes, and they represent industry, consulting, academia, and government. If your work involves the clean up of contaminated soil and groundwater, this book is an essential reference to keep you up to date on the most promising new developments in remediation research.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">At the time when increasing numbers of chemists are being attracted by the fascination of supposedly easy computing and associated colourful imaging, this book appears as a counterpoint. The first part focuses on fundamental concepts of quantum chemistry, covering MCSCF theory, perturbation treatments, basis set developments, density matrices, wave function instabilities to correlation effects, and momentum space theory. The second part is devoted to more practical studies, ranging from the characterisation of exotic interstellar molecules, the accurate determination of spectroscopic constants, excited states structures and EPR parameters through photochemical and charge-transfer processes, cluster chemistry and fullerenes, muonium chemistry, to the possible prediction of the response of materials to electric fields in view of nonlinear optical applications. Audience: Graduate students and researchers whose work involves quantum chemistry, molecular physics, and materials modelling.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">This book gathers original contributions from a selected group of distinguished researchers that are actively working in the theory and practical applications of solvent effects and chemical reactions. The importance of getting a good understanding of surrounding media effects on chemical reacting system is difficult to overestimate. Applications go from condensed phase chemistry, biochemical reactions in vitro to biological systems in vivo. Catalysis is a phenomenon produced by a particular system interacting with the reacting subsystem. The result may be an increment of the chemical rate or sometimes a decreased one. At the bottom, catalytic sources can be characterized as a special kind of surrounding medium effect. The materials involving in catalysis may range from inorganic components as in zeolites, homogenous components, enzymes, catalytic antibodies, and ceramic materials. . With the enormous progress achieved by computing technology, an increasing number of models and phenomenological approaches are being used to describe the effects of a given surrounding medium on the electronic properties of selected subsystem. A number of quantum chemical methods and programs, currently applied to calculate in vacuum systems, have been supplemented with a variety of model representations. With the increasing number of methodologies applied to this important field, it is becoming more and more difficult for non-specialist to cope with theoretical developments and extended applications. For this and other reasons, it is was deemed timely to produce a book where methodology and applications were analyzed and reviewed by leading experts in the field.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Entropy and entropy generation play essential roles in our understanding of many diverse phenomena ranging from cosmology to biology. Their importance is manifest in areas of immediate practical interest such as the provision of global energy as well as in others of a more fundamental flavour such as the source of order and complexity in nature. They also form the basis of most modern formulations of both equilibrium and nonequilibrium thermodynamics. Today much progress is being made in our understanding of entropy and entropy generation in both fundamental aspects and application to concrete problems. The purpose of this volume is to present some of these recent and important results in a manner that not only appeals to the entropy specialist but also makes them accessible to the nonspecialist looking for an overview of the field. This book contains fourteen contributions by leading scientists in their fields. The content covers such topics as quantum thermodynamics, nonlinear processes, gravitational and irreversible thermodynamics, the thermodynamics of Taylor dispersion, higher order transport, the mesoscopic theory of liquid crystals, simulated annealing, information and biological aspects, global energy, photovoltaics, heat and mass transport and nonlinear electrochemical systems. Audience: This work will be of value to physicists, chemists, biologists and engineers interested in the theory and applications of entropy and its generation.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">The modeling of minerals and silicated materials is a. difficult challenge faced by Solid StatePhysics, Quantum Chemistry and Molecular Dynamics communities. The difficulty of such a modeling is due to the wide diversity of elements, including heavy atoms,and types of bonding involved in such systems. Moreover, one has to consider infinite systems: either perfect cr- tals or glasses and melts. In the solid state a given chemical composition gives rise to numerous polymorphs, geometricallycloselyrelated. These polymorphs have very similar energies and related thermodynamical pr- erties which explain the complexity of their phase diagrams. The modeling of silicates and minerals covers a wide field of applications ranging from basic research to technology, from Solid State Physics to Earth and Planetary science. The use of modeling techniques yields information of different nature. In the case of chemical studies, we can mention inv- tigations on catalytic processes occurring on surfaces and in zeolite cages. These calculations find possible applications in chemical engineering, in particular in the oil industry.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">A quantitative description of the action of enzymes and other biological systems is both a challenge and a fundamental requirement for further progress in our und- standing of biochemical processes. This can help in practical design of new drugs and in the development of artificial enzymes as well as in fundamental understanding of the factors that control the activity of biological systems. Structural and biochemical st- ies have yielded major insights about the action of biological molecules and the mechanism of enzymatic reactions. However it is not entirely clear how to use this - portant information in a consistent and quantitative analysis of the factors that are - sponsible for rate acceleration in enzyme active sites. The problem is associated with the fact that reaction rates are determined by energetics (i. e. activation energies) and the available experimental methods by themselves cannot provide a correlation - tween structure and energy. Even mutations of specific active site residues, which are extremely useful, cannot tell us about the totality of the interaction between the active site and the substrate. In fact, short of inventing experiments that allow one to measure the forces in enzyme active sites it is hard to see how can one use a direct experimental approach to unambiguously correlate the structure and function of enzymes. In fact, in view of the complexity of biological systems it seems that only computers can handle the task of providing a quantitative structure-function correlation.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">The field of composite materials has seen substantial development in the past decade, New composite systems are being continually developed for various applications. Among such systems are metal, intermetallic, and superalloy matrix composites, carbon-carbon composites as well as polymer matrix composites. At the same time, a new discipline has emerged of active or smart materials, which are often constructed as composite or heterogeneous media and structures. One unifying theme in these diverse systems is the influence that uncoupled and coupled eigenfields or transformation fields exert on the various types of overall response, as well as on the respective phase responses. Problems of this kind are currently considered by different groups which may not always appreciate the similarities of the problems involved. The purpose of the IUTAM Symposium on Transformation Problems in Composite and Active Materials held in Cairo, Egypt from March 10 to 12, 1997 was to bring together representatives of the different groups so that they may interact and explore common aspects of these seemingly different problem areas. New directions in micromechanics research in both composite and active materials were also explored in the symposium. Specifically, invited lectures in the areas of inelastic behavior of composite materials, shape memory effects, functionally graded materials, transformation problems in composite structures, and adaptive structures were delivered and discussed during the three-day meeting. This book contains the printed contributions to the IUTAM Symposium.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">The IUTAM Symposium on Rheology of Bodies with Defects was held in Beijing in September, 1997. It was aimed at the development of Rheology in Solid Mechanics. Rheology is classified in Applied Mechanics Review under fluid mechanics, however, in its broadest content as was envisaged in its earlier days, it covers the whole spectrum of material behavior from elasticity, plasticity, and fluid mechanics to gas dynamics. It was thought of as a branch of continuum mechanics, but emphasized the physical aspects of different materials, and frequently proceeded from basic physical principles. As the temperature rises, the distinction between solid and fluid, and the distinction between their micro-mechanical movements, become blurred. The physical description of such materials and their movements must be based on the thermodynamic principles of state variable theory; the classical division between solid and fluid mechanics disappears. Under the classification adopted by Applied Mechanics Reviews, the subjects dealt with in this symposium come closer to viscoelasticity and viscoplasticity, especially close to the subdivision of creep dealing with creep rupture. The symposium focused at building a bridge between macroscopic and microscopic research on damage and fracture behavior of defective bodies made of metal, polymer, composite and other viscoelastic materials. Two different approaches are presented at the symposium. The first is a continuum damage theory for time-dependent evolution of defects at the macro/meso/microscopic levels.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">The aim of this volume is to offer a balanced overview of molecular Rydberg spectroscopy as it has developed over recent decades. Recent evolution has split Rydberg spectroscopy into two apparently distinct fields: the one concerns the low (n=3-5) Rydberg states, the other the very high (typically n&gt;150) Rydberg states. The former is aimed at spectral levels where Rydberg, valence-shell, and intermediate-type states interact, with a variety of photochemical consequences. The latter considers states extremely close to the ionization limit, from whereionization is possible with a very slight amount of additional energy. Recently developed techniques make it possible to produce ions in well-defined electronic, vibrational and rotational states, including states resulting from spin-orbit or Jahn-Teller splitting. It is then possible to study the structure and reactions of such state-selected ions as well as those of the corresponding neutral molecules. These techniques amount to badly needed high resolution photoelectron spectroscopy.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">This book contains the edited version of invited lectures presented at the IUTAM-Sym- sium Synthesis in Bio Solid Mechanics, held at Hotel Frederiksdal, Virum (Copenhagen), Denmark, May 24 to May 27, 1998. The symposium was attended by 48 scientist from 14 countries. Biomechanics has been a very active research area in the last 25 years and covers a very broad class of problems. The present symposium concentrated on the solid mechanics - main of biomechanics, where important problems of synthesis presently are an active and challenging part. Characteristics of biomechanical materials are not only the inhomogeneity and anisotropy, but also the capability to change in relation to actual use. These living materials call for new methods of analysis and also new methods for synthesis. By the synthesis in this context is meant design of implants or artificial control of material growth. Bone mechanics is closely related to recent work on analysis and design of microstructural anisotropic materials. Also, recent work in shape design can to some extent be useful in the more complicated problems of biomechanics. Here interface problems play an essential role. The symposium brought together scientists from mechanics, mathematics and medicine.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">The aim of this book is to provide the reader with a modern presentation of ionic solutions at interfaces, for physical chemists, chemists and theoretically oriented experimentalists in this field. The discussion is mainly on the structural and thermodynamic properties, in relation to presently available statistical mechanical models. Some dynamic properties are also presented, at a more phenomenological level. The initial chapters are devoted to the presentation of some basic concepts for bulk properties: hydrodynamic interactions, electrostatics, van der Waals forces and thermodynamics of ionic solutions in the framework of a particular model: the mean spherical approximation (MSA). Specific features of interfaces are then discussed: experimental techniques such as in-situ X-ray diffraction, STM and AFM microscopy are described. Ions at liquid/air, liquid/metal and liquid/liquid interfaces are considered from the experimental and theoretical viewpoint. Lastly some dynamic (transport) properties are included, namely the self-diffusion and conductance of small colloids (polyelectrolytes and micelles) and the kinetics of solute transfer at free liquid/liquid interfaces.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">The electron density of a non-degenerate ground state system determines essentially all physical properties of the system. This statement of the Hohenberg–Kohn theorem of Density Functional Theory plays an exceptionally important role among all the fundamental relations of Molecular Physics. In particular, the electron density distribution and the dynamic properties of this density determine both the local and global reactivities of molecules. High resolution experimental electron densities are increasingly becoming available for more and more molecules, including macromolecules such as proteins. Furthermore, many of the early difficulties with the determination of electron densities in the vicinity of light nuclei have been overcome. These electron densities provide detailed information that gives important insight into the fundamentals of molecular structure and a better understanding of chemical reactions. The results of electron density analysis are used in a variety of applied fields, such as pharmaceutical drug discovery and biotechnology. If the functional form of a molecular electron density is known, then various molecular properties affecting reactivity can be determined by quantum chemical computational techniques or alternative approximate methods.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">hemistry is the science about breaking and forming of bonds between atoms. One of the most important processes for organic chemistry is breaking bonds C–H, as well as C–C in various compounds, and primarily, in hydrocarbons. Among hydrocarbons, saturated hydrocarbons, alkanes (methane, ethane, propane, hexane etc. ), are especially attractive as substrates for chemical transformations. This is because, on the one hand, alkanes are the main constituents of oil and natural gas, and consequently are the principal feedstocks for chemical industry. On the other hand, these substances are known to be the less reactive organic compounds. Saturated hydrocarbons may be called the “noble gases of organic chemistry” and, if so, the first representative of their family – methane – may be compared with extremely inert helium. As in all comparisons, this parallel between noble gases and alkanes is not fully accurate. Indeed the transformations of alkanes, including methane, have been known for a long time. These reactions involve the interaction with molecular oxygen from air (burning – the main source of energy!), as well as some mutual interconversions of saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons. However, all these transformations occur at elevated temperatures (higher than 300–500 °C) and are usually characterized by a lack of selectivity. The conversion of alkanes into carbon dioxide and water during burning is an extremely valuable process – but not from a chemist viewpoint.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Contributed by world-renowned specialists on the occasion of Paul Germain's 80th birthday, this unique book reflects the foundational works and the intellectual influence of this author. It presents the realm of modern thermomechanics with its extraordinary wealth of applications to the behaviour of materials, whether solid or fluid. The thirty-one contributions follow an easygoing autobiographical sketch by Paul Germain, and highlight the power and richness of a methodological approach to the phenomenology of many materials. This approach combines harmoniously thermodynamics and continuum theory in order to provide exploitable, thermodynamically admissible models of a large variety of behaviours and phenomena, including those of diffusion, thermoelasticity, viscoplasticity, relaxation, hysteresis, wetting, shape-memory effects, growth, phase transitions, stability, fracture, shocks, machining of materials, microstructured solids, complex fluids, etc. Especially aimed at graduate students, researchers, and engineers in mechanical engineering and materials science, this book also presents the state of the art in an active field of research and opens new horizons in other scientific fields, such as applied mathematics and applied physics, because of the intellectual satisfaction and remarkable efficiency provided by the advocated approach.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">In the last decade there have been numerous advances in the area of rhodium-catalyzed hydroformylation, such as highly selective catalysts of industrial importance, new insights into mechanisms of the reaction, very selective asymmetric catalysts, in situ characterization and application to organic synthesis. The views on hydroformylation which still prevail in the current textbooks have become obsolete in several respects. Therefore, it was felt timely to collect these advances in a book. The book contains a series of chapters discussing several rhodium systems arranged according to ligand type, including asymmetric ligands, a chapter on applications in organic chemistry, a chapter on modern processes and separations, and a chapter on catalyst preparation and laboratory techniques. This book concentrates on highlights, rather than a concise review mentioning all articles in just one line. The book aims at an audience of advanced students, experts in the field, and scientists from related fields. The didactic approach also makes it useful as a guide for an advanced course.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">The request to organize under its patronage at Poitiers in 1998 a Symposium entitled “Advanced Optical Methods and Applications in Solid Mechanics” by the International Union of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics (I.U.T.A.M.) was well received for the following two reasons. First, for nearly 20 years no Symposium devoted to optical methods in solids had been organized. Second, recent advances in digital image processing provided many new applications which are described in the following. We have the honour to present here the proceedings of this Symposium. st th The Symposium took place from august 31 to September 4 at the Institut International de la Prospective in Futuroscope near Poitiers. A significant number of internationally renowned specialists had expressed their wish to participate in this meeting. The Scientific Committee proposed 16 general conferences and selected 33 regular lectures and 17 poster presentations. Papers corresponding to posters are not differentiated in the proceedings from those that were presented orally. It is worth noting that a total of 80 participants, representing 16 countries, registered for this symposium.. The Scientific Committee deserves praise for attracting a significant number of young scientists, both as authors and as participants. Let us add our warm acknowledgements to Professor J.W. Dally and to Professor A.S. Kobayashi who, throughout the symposium preparation time, brought us valuable help.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">This book is meant to provide a window on the rapidly growing body of theoretical studies of condensed phase chemistry. A brief perusal of physical chemistry journals in the early to mid 1980’s will find a large number of theor- ical papers devoted to 3-body gas phase chemical reaction dynamics. The recent history of theoretical chemistry has seen an explosion of progress in the devel- ment of methods to study similar properties of systems with Avogadro’s number of particles. While the physical properties of condensed phase systems have long been principle targets of statistical mechanics, microscopic dynamic theories that start from detailed interaction potentials and build to first principles predictions of properties are now maturing at an extraordinary rate. The techniques in use range from classical studies of new Generalized Langevin Equations, semicl- sical studies for non-adiabatic chemical reactions in condensed phase, mixed quantum classical studies of biological systems, to fully quantum studies of m- els of condensed phase environments. These techniques have become sufficiently sophisticated, that theoretical prediction of behavior in actual condensed phase environments is now possible. and in some cases, theory is driving development in experiment. The authors and chapters in this book have been chosen to represent a wide variety in the current approaches to the theoretical chemistry of condensed phase systems. I have attempted a number of groupings of the chapters, but the - versity of the work always seems to frustrate entirely consistent grouping.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Modern Solid Mechanics considers phenomena at many levels, ranging from nano size at atomic scale through the continuum level at millimeter size to large structures at the tens of meter scale. The deformation and fracture behavior at these various scales are inextricably related to interdisciplinary methods derived from applied mathematics, physics, chemistry, and engineering mechanics. This book, in honor of James R. Rice, contains articles from his colleagues and former students that bring these sophisticated methods to bear on a wide range of problems. Articles discussing problems of deformation include topics of dislocation mechanics, second particle effects, plastic yield criterion on porous materials, hydrogen embrittlement, solid state sintering, nanophases at surfaces, adhesion and contact mechanics, diffuse instability in geomaterials, and percolation in metal deformation. In the fracture area, the topics include: elastic-plastic crack growth, dynamic fracture, stress intensity and J-integral analysis, stress-corrosion cracking, and fracture in single crystal, piezoelectric, composite and cementitious materials. The book will be a valuable resource for researchers in modern solid mechanics and can be used as reference or supplementary text in mechanical and civil engineering, applied mechanics, materials science, and engineering graduate courses on fracture mechanics, elasticity, plasticity, mechanics of materials or the application of solid mechanics to processing, and reliability of life predictions.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">During the last decades, continuum mechanics of porous materials has achieved great attention, since it allows for the consideration of the volumetrically coupled behaviour of the solid matrix deformation and the pore-fluid flow. Naturally, applications of porous media models range from civil and environmental engineering, where, e. g. , geote- nical problems like the consolidation problem are of great interest, via mechanical engineering, where, e. g. , the description of sinter materials or polymeric and metallic foams is a typical problem, to chemical and biomechanical engineering, where, e. g. , the complex structure of l- ing tissues is studied. Although these applications are principally very different, they basically fall into the category of multiphase materials, which can be described, on the macroscale, within the framework of the well-founded Theory of Porous Media (TPM). With the increasing power of computer hardware together with the rapidly decreasing computational costs, numerical solutions of complex coupled problems became possible and have been seriously investigated. However, since the quality of the numerical solutions strongly depends on the quality of the underlying physical model together with the experimental and mathematical possibilities to successfully determine realistic material parameters, a successful treatment of porous materials requires a joint consideration of continuum mechanics, experimental mechanics and numerical methods. In addition, micromechanical - vestigations and homogenization techniques are very helpful to increase the phenomenological understanding of such media.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">The optimal control of flexible structures is an active area of research. The main body of work in this area is concerned with the control of time-dependent displacements and stresses, and assumes linear elastic conditions, namely linear elastic material behavior and small defor- tion. See, e. g. , [1]–[3], the collections of papers [4, 5], and references therein. On the other hand, in the present paper we consider the static optimal control of a structure made of a nonlinear elastic material and und- going large deformation. An important application is the suppression of static or quasi-static elastic deformation in flexible space structures such as parts of satellites by the use of control loads [6]. Solar rad- tion and radiation from other sources induce a temperature field in the structure, which in turn generates an elastic displacement field. The displacements must usually satisfy certain limitations dictated by the allowed working conditions of various orientation-sensitive instruments and antennas in the space vehicle. For example, a parabolic reflector may cease to be effective when undergoing large deflection. The elastic deformation can be reduced by use of control loads, which may be imp- mented via mechanically-based actuators or more modern piezoelectric devices. When the structure under consideration is made of a rubb- like material and is undergoing large deformation, nonlinear material and geometric effects must be taken into account in the analysis.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">The IUTAM Symposium on Mechanical and Electromagnetic Waves in Structured Media took place at the University of Sydney from January 18- 22, 1999. It brought together leading researchers from eleven countries for a week-long meeting, with the aim of providing cross-links between the com- nities studying related problems involving elastic and electromagnetic waves in structured materials. After the meeting, participants were invited to submit articles based on their presentations, which were refereed and assembled to constitute these Proceedings. The topics covered here represent areas at the forefront of research intoelastic and electromagnetic waves. They include effect of nonlinearity, diffusion and multiple scattering on waves, as well as asymptotic and numerical techniques. Composite materials are discussed in depth, with example systems ranging fromdusty plasmas to a magneto-elastic microstructured system. Also included are studies of homogenisation, that field which seeks to determine equivalent homogeneous systems which can give equivalent wave properties to structured materials, and inverse problems, in which waves are used as a probe to infer structural details concerning scattering systems. There are also strong groups of papers on the localization of waves by random systems, and photonic and phononic band gap materials. These are being developed by analogue with semiconductors for electrons, and hold out the promise of enabling designers to control the propagation of waves through materials in novel ways.

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">The 20th International Congress of Theoretical and Applied Mech- ics, ICTAM 2000, took place August 27 – September 2, 2000, in the c- ference facilities of the Chicago Marriott Downtown on Michigan Avenue in Chicago, Illinois, USA. The Congress was invited by the US National Academy of Sciences on the recommendation of its National Comm- tee on Theoretical and Applied Mechanics. A consortium of university departments and programs acted as the local hosts. The undersigned served, respectively, as President and Secretary-General of the Congress. In this Proceedings volume we have attempted to capture the exci- ment of that memorable week. We have laid out the book so that it, roughly, tracks the events during the week of the Congress in much the order in which they occurred. We have given addresses and reports in context, although sometimes with embellishments to provide more data than could reasonably be presented orally. We have tried to reproduce essentials of the Opening and Closing ceremonies for the benefit of those who could not attend one or the other. We have tried to assemble an attractive volume that will have lasting value by adding an extensive name index and a briefer keyword index, and by exercising considerable care in the consistency of the layout of the full manuscripts. The international congresses of mechanics are major events of the field—we compare them to the Olympic Games in sports.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Principles of Digital Transmission is designed for advanced undergraduate and graduate level students and professions in telecommunications. Teachers and learners can mix and match chapters to create four distinct courses: (1) a one-term basic course in digital communications; (2) a one-term course in advanced digital communications; (3) a one-term course in information theory and coding; (4) a two-term course sequence in digital communications and coding. The book provides rigorous mathematical tools for the analysis and design of digital transmission systems. The authors emphasize methodology in their aim to teach the reader how to do it rather than how it is done. They apply the fundamental tools of the discipline onto a number of systems, such as wireless data transmission systems.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">As suggested by the title of this book, I will present a collection of coherently related applications and a theoretical development of a general systems theory. Hopefully, this book will invite all readers to sample an exciting and challenging (even fun!) piece of interdisciplinary research, that has characterized the scientific and technological achievements of the twentieth century. And, I hope that many of them will be motivated to do additional reading and to contribute to topics along the lines described in the following pages. Since the applications in this volume range through many scientific disciplines, from sociology to atomic physics, from Einstein’s relativity theory to Dirac’s quan tum mechanics, from optimization theory to unreasonable effectiveness of mathe matics to foundations of mathematical modeling, from general systems theory to Schwartz’s distributions, special care has been given to write each application in a language appropriate to that field. That is, mathematical symbols and abstractions are used at different levels so that readers in various fields will find it possible to read. Also, because of the wide range of applications, each chapter has been written so that, in general, there is no need to reference a different chapter in order to understand a specific application. At the same time, if a reader has the desire to go through the entire book without skipping any chapter, it is strongly suggested to refer back to Chapters 2 and 3 as often as possible.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">A gentle introduction to the highly sophisticated world of discrete mathematics, Mathematical Problems and Proofs presents topics ranging from elementary definitions and theorems to advanced topics -- such as cardinal numbers, generating functions, properties of Fibonacci numbers, and Euclidean algorithm. This excellent primer illustrates more than 150 solutions and proofs, thoroughly explained in clear language. The generous historical references and anecdotes interspersed throughout the text create interesting intermissions that will fuel readers' eagerness to inquire further about the topics and some of our greatest mathematicians. The author guides readers through the process of solving enigmatic proofs and problems, and assists them in making the transition from problem solving to theorem proving. At once a requisite text and an enjoyable read, Mathematical Problems and Proofs is an excellent entrée to discrete mathematics for advanced students interested in mathematics, engineering, and science.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">THE CONTEXT OF PARALLEL PROCESSING The field of digital computer architecture has grown explosively in the past two decades. Through a steady stream of experimental research, tool-building efforts, and theoretical studies, the design of an instruction-set architecture, once considered an art, has been transformed into one of the most quantitative branches of computer technology. At the same time, better understanding of various forms of concurrency, from standard pipelining to massive parallelism, and invention of architectural structures to support a reasonably efficient and user-friendly programming model for such systems, has allowed hardware performance to continue its exponential growth. This trend is expected to continue in the near future. This explosive growth, linked with the expectation that performance will continue its exponential rise with each new generation of hardware and that (in stark contrast to software) computer hardware will function correctly as soon as it comes off the assembly line, has its down side. It has led to unprecedented hardware complexity and almost intolerable dev- opment costs. The challenge facing current and future computer designers is to institute simplicity where we now have complexity; to use fundamental theories being developed in this area to gain performance and ease-of-use benefits from simpler circuits; to understand the interplay between technological capabilities and limitations, on the one hand, and design decisions based on user and application requirements on the other.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">This book reflects thirty years of experience in the applications of computer technology to literary research and instruction and in consulting work in office automation and system integration. In that time I have again and again found myself in the position of having to introduce students, both undergraduate and graduate, colleagues and clients to the fundamentals of computer hardware and software. Over the years, as computers became both central and commonplace in professional life, I have been aware of changing attitudes toward this technology. From attitudes that ranged from the disdain of platonic dialecticians for mere technology to intimidation bordering at times almost on terror, people have moved to incorporate this new technology into their frame of reference ( humani nil a me alienum ). The development of the microprocessor and its subsequent use for word processing marked one important watershed. The widespread use of word processors made it more likely than not that people would own their own computers, at least at work, and use them as part of their work-a-day activities. But while word processing provided some increased familiarity with computers, it did not lead most indivi- als much beyond a knowledge of the usual incantations needed to control the MultiMate or Nota Bene or Word Perfect golam and, as a result of unhappy experience, a begrudging acceptance of the need to make back up copies of important files.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">In 1978, when the book Living Systems was published, it contained the prediction that the sciences that were concerned with the biological and social sciences would, in the future, be stated as rigorously as the “hard sciences” that study such nonliving phenomena as temperature, distance, and the interaction of chemical elements. Principles of Quantitative Living Systems Science, the first of a planned series of three books, begins an attempt to fulfill that prediction. The view that living things are similar to other parts of the physical world, differing only in their complexity, was explicitly stated in the early years of the twentieth century by the biologist Ludwig von Bertalanffy. His ideas could not be published until the end of the war in Europe in the 1940s. Von Bertalanffy was strongly opposed to vitalism, the theory current among biologists at the time that life could only be explained by recourse to a “vital principle” or God. He c- sidered living things to be a part of the natural order, “systems” like atoms and molecules and planetary systems. Systems were described as being made up of a number of interrelated and interdependent parts, but because of the interrelations, the total system became more than the sum of those parts. These ideas led to the development of systems movements, in both Europe and the United States, that included not only biologists but scientists in other fields as well. Systems societies were formed on both continents.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Here is a comprehensive presentation of methodology for the design and synthesis of an intelligent complex robotic system, connecting formal tools from discrete system theory, artificial intelligence, neural network, and fuzzy logic. The necessary methods for solving real time action planning, coordination and control problems are described. A notable chapter presents a new approach to intelligent robotic agent control acting in a realworld environment based on a lifelong learning approach combining cognitive and reactive capabilities. Another key feature is the homogeneous description of all solutions and methods based on system theory formalism.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">This book provides an overview of the X Window System focusing on characteristics that have significant impact on the development of both application programs and widgets. We pay special attention to applications that go beyond graphical user interfaces (GUIs); therefore we discuss issues affecting video games, visualization and imaging programs, and designing widgets with a complex appearance. While the book does not assume previous knowledge of X, it is intended for experienced programmers, especially those who want to write programs that go beyond simple GUIs. X is the dominant window system under Unix, and X servers are available for Microsoft Windows, thus enabling graphics over a network in the PC world. While Java offers an apparently universal graphics library (the abstract window toolkit), the reality is quite different: For high-quality graphics and image display, we must program on the target platform itself (X or one of Microsoft’s APIs) rather than rely on Java peer objects. X is a vast subject, so it is impossible to provide a complete coverage in a few hundred pages. Thus we selected topics that are fundamental to the system, so that the reader who masters them should be able to read the documentation of the numerous libraries and toolkits. Therefore we provide documentation on the most important Xlib and X toolkit functions only.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Elliptic cohomology is an extremely beautiful theory with both geometric and arithmetic aspects. The former is explained by the fact that the theory is a quotient of oriented cobordism localised away from 2, the latter by the fact that the coefficients coincide with a ring of modular forms. The aim of the book is to construct this cohomology theory, and evaluate it on classifying spaces BG of finite groups G. This class of spaces is important, since (using ideas borrowed from `Monstrous Moonshine') it is possible to give a bundle-theoretic definition of EU-(BG). Concluding chapters also discuss variants, generalisations and potential applications.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Since the first edition of this book was published seven years ago, the field of modeling and simulation of communication systems has grown and matured in many ways, and the use of simulation as a day-to-day tool is now even more common practice. With the current interest in digital mobile communications, a primary area of application of modeling and simulation is now in wireless systems of a different flavor from the `traditional' ones. This second edition represents a substantial revision of the first, partly to accommodate the new applications that have arisen. New chapters include material on modeling and simulation of nonlinear systems, with a complementary section on related measurement techniques, channel modeling and three new case studies; a consolidated set of problems is provided at the end of the book.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Enterprises all over the world are experiencing a rapid development of networked computing for applications that are required for the daily survival of an organization. Client-server computing offers great potential for cost-effective networked computing. However, many organizations have now learned that the cost of maintenance and support of these networked distributed systems far exceeds the cost of buying them. Computer Supported Creative Work (CSCW) is the new evolving area that promotes the understanding of business processes and relevant communication technologies. Cooperative Management of Enterprise Networks uses CSCW as the medium for conveying ideas on the integration of business processes with network and systems management. This book will be useful for systems management professionals wishing to know about business process integration; business managers wishing to integrate their tasks with network/systems management; software system developers wishing to adopt participatory design practices; and students and researchers.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">1. MOTIVATION In many physical situations, a plant model is often provided with a qualitative or quantitative measure of associated model uncertainties. On the one hand, the validity of the model is guaranteed only inside a frequency band, so that nearly nothing can be said about the behavior of the real plant at high frequencies. On the other hand, if the model is derived on the basis of physical equations, it can be parameterized as a function of a few physical parameters, which are usually not perfectly known in practice. This is e.g. the case in aeronautical systems: as an example, the ae- dynamic model of an airplane is derived from the flight mechanics eq- tions. When synthesizing the aircraft control law, it is then necessary to take into account uncertainties in the values of the stability derivatives, which correspond to the physical coefficients of the aerodynamic model. Moreover, this airplane model does not perfectly represent the be- vior of the real aircraft. As a simple example, the flight control system or the autopilot are usually synthesized just using the aerodynamic model, thus without accounting for the flexible mechanicalstructure: the c- responding dynamics are indeed considered as high frequency neglected 1 dynamics, with respect to the dynamics of the rigid model .</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Multi-carrier modulation, in particular orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), has been successfully applied to a wide variety of digital communications applications for several years. Although OFDM has been chosen as the physical layer standard for a diversity of important systems, the theory, algorithms, and implementation techniques remain subjects of current interest. This book is intended to be a concise summary of the present state of the art of the theory and practice of OFDM technology. This book offers a unified presentation of OFDM theory and high speed and wireless applications. In particular, ADSL, wireless LAN, and digital broadcasting technologies are explained. It is hoped that this book will prove valuable both to developers of such systems, and to researchers and graduate students involved in analysis of digital communications, and will remain a valuable summary of the technology, providing an understanding of new advances as well as the present core technology.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Intuitionistic logic is presented here as part of familiar classical logic which allows mechanical extraction of programs from proofs. to make the material more accessible, basic techniques are presented first for propositional logic; Part II contains extensions to predicate logic. This material provides an introduction and a safe background for reading research literature in logic and computer science as well as advanced monographs. Readers are assumed to be familiar with basic notions of first order logic. One device for making this book short was inventing new proofs of several theorems. The presentation is based on natural deduction. The topics include programming interpretation of intuitionistic logic by simply typed lambda-calculus (Curry-Howard isomorphism), negative translation of classical into intuitionistic logic, normalization of natural deductions, applications to category theory, Kripke models, algebraic and topological semantics, proof-search methods, interpolation theorem. The text developed from materal for several courses taught at Stanford University in 1992-1999.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">This book introduces the fundamental concepts and practical simulation te- niques for modeling different aspects of operating systems to study their g- eral behavior and their performance. The approaches applied are obje- oriented modeling and process interaction approach to discrete-event simu- tion. The book depends on the basic modeling concepts and is more specialized than my previous book: Practical Process Simulation with Object-Oriented Techniques and C++, published by Artech House, Boston 1999. For a more detailed description see the Web location: http://science.kennesaw.edu/~jgarrido/mybook,html. Most other books on performance modeling use only analytical approaches, and very few apply these concepts to the study of operating systems. Thus, the unique feature of the book is that it concentrates on design aspects of operating systems using practical simulation techniques. In addition, the book illustrates the dynamic behavior of different aspects of operating systems using the various simulation models, with a general hands-on approach.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Graph Separators with Applications is devoted to techniques for obtaining upper and lower bounds on the sizes of graph separators - upper bounds being obtained via decomposition algorithms. The book surveys the main approaches to obtaining good graph separations, while the main focus of the book is on techniques for deriving lower bounds on the sizes of graph separators. This asymmetry in focus reflects our perception that the work on upper bounds, or algorithms, for graph separation is much better represented in the standard theory literature than is the work on lower bounds, which we perceive as being much more scattered throughout the literature on application areas. Given the multitude of notions of graph separator that have been developed and studied over the past (roughly) three decades, there is a need for a central, theory-oriented repository for the mass of results. The need is absolutely critical in the area of lower-bound techniques for graph separators, since these techniques have virtually never appeared in articles having the word `separator' or any of its near-synonyms in the title. Graph Separators with Applications fills this need.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">The solution of eigenvalue problems is an integral part of many scientific computations. For example, the numerical solution of problems in structural dynamics, electrical networks, macro-economics, quantum chemistry, and c- trol theory often requires solving eigenvalue problems. The coefficient matrix of the eigenvalue problem may be small to medium sized and dense, or large and sparse (containing many zeroelements). In the past tremendous advances have been achieved in the solution methods for symmetric eigenvalue pr- lems. The state of the art for nonsymmetric problems is not so advanced; nonsymmetric eigenvalue problems can be hopelessly difficult to solve in some situations due, for example, to poor conditioning. Good numerical algorithms for nonsymmetric eigenvalue problems also tend to be far more complex than their symmetric counterparts. This book deals with methods for solving a special nonsymmetric eig- value problem; the symplectic eigenvalue problem. The symplectic eigenvalue problem is helpful, e.g., in analyzing a number of different questions that arise in linear control theory for discrete-time systems. Certain quadratic eigenvalue problems arising, e.g., in finite element discretization in structural analysis, in acoustic simulation of poro-elastic materials, or in the elastic deformation of anisotropic materials can also lead to symplectic eigenvalue problems. The problem appears in other applications as well.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">A re-working of C.D. Chaffee's previously published The Rewiring of America (Academia, 1988), this professional book describes the fiber optics revolution. There have been many changes in the fiber optics field since the book's first publication. These include advances in optical networking; the additional bandwidth created by the Internet and associated data services; liberalization of the global telecommunications industry; and the rewiring of the world's oceans with fiber optics. Building the Global Fiber Optics Superhighway details all these developments. C.D. Chaffee writes: `One thing is clear: as our networks become primarily data-driven, they need to be built differently, to be able to handle data first, but also voice. It is a different way of looking at the world.'</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Most everything in our experience requires management in some form or other: our gardens, our automobiles, our minds, our bodies, our love lives, our businesses, our forests, our countries, etc. Sometimes we don’t call it “management” per se. We seldom talk about managing our minds or automobiles. But if we think of management in terms of monitoring, maintaining, and cultivating with respect to some goal, then it makes sense. We certainly monitor an automobile, albeit unconsciously, to make sure that it doesn’t exhibit signs of trouble. And we certainly try to cultivate our minds. This book is about managing networks. That itself is not a new concept. We’ve been managing the networks that support our telephones for about 100 years, and we’ve been managing the networks that support our computers for about 20 years. What is new (and what motivated me to write this book) is the following: (i) the enormous advancements in networking technology as we transition th st from the 20 century to the 21 century, (ii) the increasing dependence of human activities on networking technology, and (iii) the commercialization of services that depend on networking technology (e.g., email and electronic commerce).</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Active networking is an exciting new paradigm in digital networking that has the potential to revolutionize the manner in which communication takes place. It is an emerging technology, one in which new ideas are constantly being formulated and new topics of research are springing up even as this book is being written. This technology is very likely to appeal to a broad spectrum of users from academia and industry. Therefore, this book was written in a way that enables all these groups to understand the impact of active networking in their sphere of interest. Information services managers, network administrators, and e-commerce developers would like to know the potential benefits of the new technology to their businesses, networks, and applications. The book introduces the basic active networking paradigm and its potential impacts on the future of information handling in general and on communications in particular. This is useful for forward-looking businesses that wish to actively participate in the development of active networks and ensure a head start in the integration of the technology in their future products, be they applications or networks. Areas in which active networking is likely to make significant impact are identified, and the reader is pointed to any related ongoing research efforts in the area. The book also provides a deeper insight into the active networking model for students and researchers, who seek challenging topics that define or extend frontiers of the technology. It describes basic components of the model, explains some of the terms used by the active networking community, and provides the reader with taxonomy of the research being conducted at the time this book was written. Current efforts are classified based on typical research areas such as mobility, security, and management. The intent is to introduce the serious reader to the background regarding some of the models adopted by the community, to outline outstanding issues concerning active networking, and to provide a snapshot of the fast-changing landscape in active networking research. Management is a very important issue in active networks because of its open nature. The latter half of the book explains the architectural concepts of a model for managing active networks and the motivation for a reference model that addresses limitations of the current network management framework by leveraging the powerful features of active networking to develop an integrated framework. It also describes a novel application enabled by active network technology called the Active Virtual Network Management Prediction (AVNMP) algorithm. AVNMP is a pro-active management system; in other words, it provides the ability to solve a potential problem before it impacts the system by modeling network devices within the network itself and running that model ahead of real time.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">This book initiates a new digital multimedia standards series. The purpose of the series is to make information about digital multimedia standards readilyavailable. Both tutorial and advanced topics will be covered in the series, often in one book. Our hope is that users will find the series helpful in deciding what standards to support and use while implementors will d- cover a wealth of technical details that help them implement those standards correctly. In today's global economy standards are increasingly important. Yet until a standard is widely used, most of the benefits of standardization are not realized. We hope that standards committee chairpeople will organize and encourage a book in this series devoted to their new standard. This can be a forum to share and preserve some ofthe “why” and “how” that went into the development of the standard and, in the process, assist in the rapid adoption of the standard. Already in production for this series are books titled Digital Video: - troduction to MPEG-2 and Data Compression in Digital Systems.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Conflicts between agents acting in a multi-agent environment arise for different reasons, involve different concepts, and are dealt with in different ways, depending on the kind of agents and on the domain where they are considered. Agents may have conflicting beliefs, conflicting goals, or may have to share limited resources. Consequently, conflicts may be expressed as mere differences, or as contradictions, or even as social conflicts. They may be avoided, solved, kept, or even created deliberately. Conflicting Agents studies conflicts in the context of multi-agent systems, i.e. artificial societies modeled on the basis of autonomous, interacting agents. This book addresses questions about types of conflicts, conflict definitions and the use of conflicts as trigger functions for activities in multi-agent systems. The book is also dedicated to questions of conflict management, resolution and avoidance, i.e. the question of how agents cope with conflicts and conflicting situations.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">In recent years, tremendous research has been devoted to the design of database systems for real-time applications, called real-time database systems (RTDBS), where transactions are associated with deadlines on their completion times, and some of the data objects in the database are associated with temporal constraints on their validity. Examples of important applications of RTDBS include stock trading systems, navigation systems and computer integrated manufacturing. Different transaction scheduling algorithms and concurrency control protocols have been proposed to satisfy transaction timing data temporal constraints. Other design issues important to the performance of a RTDBS are buffer management, index accesses and I/O scheduling. Real-Time Database Systems: Architecture and Techniques summarizes important research results in this area, and serves as an excellent reference for practitioners, researchers and educators of real-time systems and database systems.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">"I have been using OmniMark for a decade to solve many different kinds of information management problems. When OmniMark Technologies Corporation added features to their excellent language that allowed server functionality and database access, OmniMark became an even better, more powerful platform for data processing. When they made it free, it made me wonder why anyone is still using Perl. I have used OmniMark as a very stable middle-tier programming language that is lightning fast, scaleable, and really fun to use. The language has a certain elegance that, once you learn how to `think OmniMark', you never want to even consider the alternatives. The native hierarchical architecture of the language, plus its luxuriously rich pattern matching syntax and support for structured information using XML and SGML parsing, make OmniMark a real joy. "This book covers the core language, plus practical examples for common Internet programming applications. OmniMark is such a powerful program that I can't think of any Internet programming problem that can't be solved with OmniMark. This book makes that clear in real, understandable terms." -Brian Travis, is the author of OmniMark At Work Volume 1: Getting Started and XML and SOAP Programming for Biz-Talk® Servers "OmniMark has been the secret weapon of markup language programmers since the earliest days of SGML. Its new XML support should bring it to a far wider audience." -Charles F. Goldfarb, is the inventor of SGML and author of The XML Handbook.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">This book emerged from teaching a graduate level course in propagation and smart antennas at the Naval Postgraduate School. In its present form, it is suitable not only as a graduate level text, but also as a reference book for industry and research use. The area of radiowave propagation and smart antennas is highly interdisciplinary, extracting material from electromagn- ics, communications, and signal processing. This book is useful to workers in electromagnetics who would like to supplement their background with relevant communicational aspects and to workers in communications who would like to supplement their background with relevant electromagnetic aspects. Anyone with a basic understanding of probability, wave propagation, digital com- nications, and elementary signal processing should be able to appreciate the contents of the book. The book consists of nine chapters with several worked out examples d- persed throughout. Chapter 1 covers the basics of cellular communications. Chapter 2 covers the basic principles of electromagnetic wave propagation relevant to path loss predictions in wireless communications. Students with little prior background in electromagnetics should find the first few sections of Chapter 2 self-sufficient. Empirical path loss models that are used in system design are treated in Chapter 3. The chapter includes the traditional models as well as some of the newer models. Chapter 4 has a thorough discussion on the causes and characterization of small scale fading. The topic of spatial c- relation that is very important for antenna arrays is discussed there in detail.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Current database technology and computer hardware allow us to gather, store, access, and manipulate massive volumes of raw data in an efficient and inexpensive manner. In addition, the amount of data collected and warehoused in all industries is growing every year at a phenomenal rate. Nevertheless, our ability to discover critical, non-obvious nuggets of useful information in data that could influence or help in the decision making process, is still limited. Knowledge discovery (KDD) and Data Mining (DM) is a new, multidisciplinary field that focuses on the overall process of information discovery from large volumes of data. The field combines database concepts and theory, machine learning, pattern recognition, statistics, artificial intelligence, uncertainty management, and high-performance computing. To remain competitive, businesses must apply data mining techniques such as classification, prediction, and clustering using tools such as neural networks, fuzzy logic, and decision trees to facilitate making strategic decisions on a daily basis. Knowledge Discovery for Business Information Systems contains a collection of 16 high quality articles written by experts in the KDD and DM field from the following countries: Austria, Australia, Bulgaria, Canada, China (Hong Kong), Estonia, Denmark, Germany, Italy, Poland, Singapore and USA.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Delivering MPEG-4 Based Audio-Visual Services investigates the different aspects of end-to-end multimedia services; content creation, server and service provider, network, and the end-user terminal. Part I provides a comprehensive introduction to digital video communications, MPEG standards, and technologies, and deals with system level issues including standardization and interoperability, user interaction, and the design of a distributed video server. Part II investigates the systems in the context of object-based multimedia services and presents a design for an object-based audio-visual terminal, some of these features having been adopted by the MPEG-4 Systems specification. The book goes on to study the requirements for a file format to represent object-based audio-visual content and the design of one such format. The design introduces new concepts such as direct streaming that are essential for scalable servers. The final part of the book examines the delivery of object-based multimedia presentations and gives optimal algorithms for multiplex-scheduling of object-based audio-visual presentations, showing that the audio-visual object scheduling problem is NP-complete in the strong sense. The problem of scheduling audio-visual objects is similar to the problem of sequencing jobs on a single machine. The book compares these problems and adapts job-sequencing results to audio-visual object scheduling, and provides optimal algorithms for scheduling presentations under resource constraints, such as bandwidth (network constraints) and buffer (terminal constraints). In addition, the book presents algorithms that minimize the resources required for scheduling presentations and the auxiliary capacity required to support interactivity in object-based audio-visual presentations. Delivering MPEG-4 Based Audio-Visual Services is essential reading for researchers and practitioners in the areas of multimedia systems engineering and multimedia computing, network professionals, service providers, and all scientists and technical managers interested in the most up-to-date MPEG standards and technologies.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">This book focuses on a specific engineering problem that is and will continue to be important in the forth-coming information age: namely, the need for highly integrated radio systems that can be embedded in wireless devices for various applications, including portable mobile multimedia wireless communications, wireless appliances, digital cellular, and digital cordless. Traditionally, the design of radio IC’s involves a team of engineers trained in a wide range of fields that include networking, communication systems, radio propagation, digital/analog circuits, RF circuits, and process technology. However as radio IC’s become more integrated, the need for a diverse skill set and knowledge becomes essential for professionals as well as students to broaden beyond their trained area of expertise and to become proficient in related areas. The key to designing an optimized, economical solution for radio systems on a chip hinges on the designer’s thorough understanding of the complex trade-offs from communication systems down to circuits. To acquire the insight and understanding of the complex system and circuit trade-offs, a designer must digest volumes of books covering diverse topics, such as communications theory, radio propagation, and digital/analog/RF circuits. While books are available today that cover the individual areas, they tend to be narrowly focused and do not provide the necessary insight in the specific problem of integrating a complete radio system on a chip.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">The Analog to Digital Converters represent one half of the link between the world we live in - analog - and the digital world of computers, which can handle the computations required in digital signal processing. These devices are mathematically very complex due to their nonlinear behavior and thus fairly difficult to analyze without the use of simulation tools. High Speed A/D Converters: Understanding Data Converters Through SPICE presents the subject from the practising engineer's point of view rather than from the academic's point of view. A practical approach is emphasized. High Speed A/D Converters: Understanding Data Converters Through SPICE is intended as a learning tool by providing building blocks that can be stacked on top of each other to build higher order systems. The book provides a guide to understanding the various topologies used in A/D converters by suggesting simple methods for the blocks used in an A/D converter. The converters discussed throughout the book constitute a class of devices called undersampled or Nyquist converters. The tools used in deriving the results presented are: TopSpice® by Penzar - a mixed mode SPICE simulator - version 5.90. The files included in Appendix A were written for this tool. However, most circuit files need only minor adjustments to be used on other SPICE simulators such as PSpice, Hspice, IS_Spice and Micro-Cap IV; Mathcad 2000 - Professional by Mathsoft. This tool is very useful in performing FFT analysis as well as drawing some of the graphs. Again, the mathcad files are included to help the user analyze the data. High Speed A/D Converters: Understanding Data Converters Through SPICE not only supplies the models for the A/D converters for SPICE program but also describes the physical reasons for the converter's performance.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Bayesian Approach to Image Interpretation will interest anyone working in image interpretation. It is complete in itself and includes background material. This makes it useful for a novice as well as for an expert. It reviews some of the existing probabilistic methods for image interpretation and presents some new results. Additionally, there is extensive bibliography covering references in varied areas. For a researcher in this field, the material on synergistic integration of segmentation and interpretation modules and the Bayesian approach to image interpretation will be beneficial. For a practicing engineer, the procedure for generating knowledge base, selecting initial temperature for the simulated annealing algorithm, and some implementation issues will be valuable. New ideas introduced in the book include: New approach to image interpretation using synergism between the segmentation and the interpretation modules. A new segmentation algorithm based on multiresolution analysis. Novel use of the Bayesian networks (causal networks) for image interpretation. Emphasis on making the interpretation approach less dependent on the knowledge base and hence more reliable by modeling the knowledge base in a probabilistic framework. Useful in both the academic and industrial research worlds, Bayesian Approach to Image Interpretation may also be used as a textbook for a semester course in computer vision or pattern recognition.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Since the early eighties IFIP/Sec has been an important rendezvous for Information Technology researchers and specialists involved in all aspects of IT security. The explosive growth of the Web is now faced with the formidable challenge of providing trusted information. IFIP/Sec’01 is the first of this decade (and century) and it will be devoted to “Trusted Information - the New Decade Challenge” This proceedings are divided in eleven parts related to the conference program. Session are dedicated to technologies: Security Protocols, Smart Card, Network Security and Intrusion Detection, Trusted Platforms. Others sessions are devoted to application like eSociety, TTP Management and PKI, Secure Workflow Environment, Secure Group Communications, and on the deployment of applications: Risk Management, Security Policies andTrusted System Design and Management. The year 2001 is a double anniversary. First, fifteen years ago, the first IFIP/Sec was held in France (IFIP/Sec’86, Monte-Carlo) and 2001 is also the anniversary of smart card technology. Smart cards emerged some twenty years ago as an innovation and have now become pervasive information devices used for highly distributed secure applications. These cards let millions of people carry a highly secure device that can represent them on a variety of networks. To conclude, we hope that the rich “menu” of conference papers for this IFIP/Sec conference will provide valuable insights and encourage specialists to pursue their work in trusted information.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">The broadband wireless communications field is growing at an explosive rate, stimulated by a host of important emerging applications ranging from 3G, 4G and wireless LAN. Wideband CDMA and CDMA2000 will be used for 3G. OFDM+CDMA might be a good choice for 4G, CDMA overlay will possibly be used for new-generation broadband wireless LAN. For system planners and designers, the projections of rapidly escalating demand for such wireless services present major challenges and meeting these challenges will require sustained technical innovation on many fronts. The text of this book has been developed through years of research by the author and his graduate students at the University of Hong Kong. The aim of this book is to provide a R&amp;D perspective on the field of broadband wireless communications by describing the recent research developments in this area and also by identifying key directions in which further research is needed. As a background, I presume that the reader has a thorough understanding of digital communications and spread spectrum/CDMA. The book is arranged into 13 chapters. In chapter 1, some key specifications of 3G WCDMA are described and discussed. These techniques include channel coding, rate matching, modulation and spreading, power control, cell search, transmit diversity, soft-handoff, and so son. In Chapter 2, the coherent RAKE reception of Wideband CDMA signals with complex spreading is considered. A dedicated pilot channel, which is separate from data channels, is used for the purpose of channel estimation.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">The growth of telecommunications has been largely based on mobile and data services in the past 10 years and the growth will continue. For instance, it is forecasted that after 2005 the mobile traffic turnover in Europe will exceed that of fixed telephone traffic and the penetration of Internet access through mobile will exceed that of fixed access. It is expected that the new value added services will be Internet-based and the IP traffic will outweigh the amount of traditional ISDN based telephone traffic. The transition from the existing telecommunications services to mobile and Internet based ones will change the service infrastructure as well as the customer and service management structures. In wireless communications there are several new standards being developed and implemented to improve the data transmission rate over radio channels, to combine both voice, packet data and multimedia services in the terminals and to improve the service quality and usability. Narrow band packet radio standards such as General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) and i-Mode are already operative and broadband IMT-2000 standards, also called as Third Generation (3G) Mobile, have been developed in Japan, Europe and US. At the same time Wireless LAN and Bluetooth technologies mature and provide short-range data access to terminal devices. The emerging new technologies create opportunities not only to incumbent teleoperators but also to new network operators, IT companies and new service and content providers.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Deformable avatars are virtual humans that deform themselves during motion. This implies facial deformations, body deformations at joints, and global deformations. Simulating deformable avatars ensures a more realistic simulation of virtual humans. The research requires models for capturing of geometrie and kinematic data, the synthesis of the realistic human shape and motion, the parametrisation and motion retargeting, and several appropriate deformation models. Once a deformable avatar has been created and animated, the researcher must model high-level behavior and introduce agent technology. The book can be divided into 5 subtopics: 1. Motion capture and 3D reconstruction 2. Parametrie motion and retargeting 3. Musc1es and deformation models 4. Facial animation and communication 5. High-level behaviors and autonomous agents Most of the papers were presented during the IFIP workshop "DEFORM '2000" that was held at the University of Geneva in December 2000, followed by "A V AT ARS 2000" held at EPFL, Lausanne. The two workshops were sponsored by the "Troisü!me Cycle Romand d'Informatique" and allowed participants to discuss the state of research in these important areas. x Preface We would like to thank IFIP for its support and Yana Lambert from Kluwer Academic Publishers for her advice. Finally, we are very grateful to Zerrin Celebi, who has prepared the edited version of this book and Dr. Laurent Moccozet for his collaboration.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Distributed applications are a necessity in most central application sectors of the contemporary information society, including e-commerce, e-banking, e-learning, e-health, telecommunication and transportation. This results from a tremendous growth of the role that the Internet plays in business, administration and our everyday activities. This trend is going to be even further expanded in the context of advances in broadband wireless communication. New Developments in Distributed Applications and Interoperable Systems focuses on the techniques available or under development with the goal to ease the burden of constructing reliable and maintainable interoperable information systems providing services in the global communicating environment. The topics covered in this book include: Context-aware applications; Integration and interoperability of distributed systems; Software architectures and services for open distributed systems; Management, security and quality of service issues in distributed systems; Software agents and mobility; Internet and other related problem areas. The book contains the proceedings of the Third International Working Conference on Distributed Applications and Interoperable Systems (DAIS'2001), which was held in September 2001 in Kraków, Poland, and sponsored by the International Federation on Information Processing (IFIP). The conference program presents the state of the art in research concerning distributed and interoperable systems. This is a topical research area where much activity is currently in progress. Interesting new aspects and innovative contributions are still arising regularly. The DAIS series of conferences is one of the main international forums where these important findings are reported.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">New Zealand schools have experienced unprecedented change during the lastdecade. Radicalrestructuringoftheframeworksforbothcurriculumand qualificationsfollowedamovementtowards self-managementin 1989. The curriculum framework, consisting of seven essential learning areas, has been progressively introduced with completionnotexpecteduntil 2002. Thenew Qualifications Framework, based on unit standards, was launched in 1994. The introduction of unit standards signalled an emphatic movement towards the use of internal assessment for awarding qualifications at the seniorsecondaryschoollevel. Eachcoursehadunitstandardsdefined,which described the outcomes and the performance criteria that would be used to determine whether or not the standard had been achieved. Approximately five to eight standards would be used for each full year course and each standard had a number of credits associated with it. The plan, which has since been modified, was for these credits to contribute to a National Certificate of Educational Achievement, at years 12 and 13, and other, subject specific, National Certificates. Secondary schools were faced with the task of recording and reporting 1 unit standardresults to theNew Zealand Qualifications Authority . This, by itself, was not a major issue as the significant suppliers of CSIS had modules availablewhichsatisfiedthis need. Atthistimeamodelwasbeingpresented to school audiences demonstrating how the recording, reporting and evaluation ofassessment data, relating to the curriculumframework, could be relatively straight forward IF there was a common assessment ‘currency’ across the school. This model was converted into software form for demonstration purposes.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">The Eighth Annual Working Conference of Information Security Management and Small Systems Security, jointly presented by WG11.1 and WG11.2 of the International Federation for Information Processing (IFIP), focuses on various state-of-art concepts in the two relevant fields. The conference focuses on technical, functional as well as managerial issues. This working conference brings together researchers and practitioners of different disciplines, organisations, and countries, to discuss the latest developments in (amongst others) information security methods, methodologies and techniques, information security management issues, risk analysis, managing information security within electronic commerce, computer crime and intrusion detection. We are fortunate to have attracted two highly acclaimed international speakers to present invited lectures, which will set the platform for the reviewed papers. Invited speakers will talk on a broad spectrum of issues, all related to information security management and small system security issues. These talks cover new perspectives on electronic commerce, security strategies, documentation and many more. All papers presented at this conference were reviewed by a minimum of two international reviewers. We wish to express our gratitude to all authors of papers and the international referee board. We would also like to express our appreciation to the organising committee, chaired by Gurpreet Dhillon, for all their inputs and arrangements. Finally, we would like to thank Les Labuschagne and Hein Venter for their contributions in compiling this proceeding for WG11.1 and WG 11.2.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Data mining involves the non-trivial extraction of implicit, previously unknown, and potentially useful information from databases. Genetic Programming (GP) and Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) are two of the approaches for data mining. This book first sets the necessary backgrounds for the reader, including an overview of data mining, evolutionary algorithms and inductive logic programming. It then describes a framework, called GGP (Generic Genetic Programming), that integrates GP and ILP based on a formalism of logic grammars. The formalism is powerful enough to represent context- sensitive information and domain-dependent knowledge. This knowledge can be used to accelerate the learning speed and/or improve the quality of the knowledge induced. A grammar-based genetic programming system called LOGENPRO (The LOGic grammar based GENetic PROgramming system) is detailed and tested on many problems in data mining. It is found that LOGENPRO outperforms some ILP systems. We have also illustrated how to apply LOGENPRO to emulate Automatically Defined Functions (ADFs) to discover problem representation primitives automatically. By employing various knowledge about the problem being solved, LOGENPRO can find a solution much faster than ADFs and the computation required by LOGENPRO is much smaller than that of ADFs. Moreover, LOGENPRO can emulate the effects of Strongly Type Genetic Programming and ADFs simultaneously and effortlessly. Data Mining Using Grammar Based Genetic Programming and Applications is appropriate for researchers, practitioners and clinicians interested in genetic programming, data mining, and the extraction of data from databases.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Market demand for microprocessor performance has motivated continued scaling of CMOS through a succession of lithography generations. Quantum mechanical limitations to continued scaling are becoming readily apparent. Partially Depleted Silicon-on-Insulator (PD-SOI) technology is emerging as a promising means of addressing these limitations. It also introduces additional design complexity which must be well understood. SOI Circuit Design Concepts first introduces the student or practicing engineer to SOI device physics and its fundamental idiosyncrasies. It then walks the reader through realizations of these mechanisms which are observed in common high-speed microprocessor designs. Rules of thumb and comparisons to conventional bulk CMOS are offered to guide implementation. SOI's ultimate advantage, however, may lie in the unique circuit topologies it supports; a number of these novel new approaches are described as well. SOI Circuit Design Concepts draws upon the latest industry literature as well as the firsthand experiences of its authors. It is an ideal introduction to the concepts of governing SOI use and provides a firm foundation for further study of this exciting new technology paradigm.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">There is an ever increasing trend towards putting entire systems on a single chip. This means that analog circuits will have to coexist on the same substrate along with massive digital systems. Since technologies are optimized with these digital systems in mind, designers will have to make do with standard CMOS processes in the years to come. We address analog filter design from this perspective. Filters form important blocks in applications ranging from computer disc-drive chips to radio transceivers. In this book, we develop the theory and techniques necessary for the implementation of high frequency (hundreds of megahertz) programmable continuous time filters in standard CMOS processes. Since high density poly-poly capacitors are not available in these technologies, alternative capacitor structures have to be found. Met- metal capacitors have low specific capacitance. An alternative is to use the (inherently nonlinear) capacitance formed by MOSFET gates. In Chapter 2, we focus on the use of MOS capacitors as integrating elements. A physics-based model which predicts distortion accurately is presented for a two-terminal MOS structure in accumulation. Distortion in these capacitors as a function of signal swing and bias voltage is computed. Chapter 3 reviews continuous-time filter architectures in the light of bias-dependent integrating capacitors. We also discuss the merits and demerits of various CMOS transconductance elements. The problems encountered in designing high frequency programmable filters are discussed in detail.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Principles of Verifiable RTL Design: A Functional Coding Style Supporting Verification Processes in Verilog explains how you can write Verilog to describe chip designs at the RT-level in a manner that cooperates with verification processes. This cooperation can return an order of magnitude improvement in performance and capacity from tools such as simulation and equivalence checkers. It reduces the labor costs of coverage and formal model checking by facilitating communication between the design engineer and the verification engineer. It also orients the RTL style to provide more useful results from the overall verification process. The intended audience for Principles of Verifiable RTL Design: A Functional Coding Style Supporting Verification Processes in Verilog is engineers and students who need an introduction to various design verification processes and a supporting functional Verilog RTL coding style. A second intended audience is engineers who have been through introductory training in Verilog and now want to develop good RTL writing practices for verification. A third audience is Verilog language instructors who are using a general text on Verilog as the course textbook but want to enrich their lectures with an emphasis on verification. A fourth audience is engineers with substantial Verilog experience who want to improve their Verilog practice to work better with RTL Verilog verification tools. A fifth audience is design consultants searching for proven verification-centric methodologies. A sixth audience is EDA verification tool implementers who want some suggestions about a minimal Verilog verification subset. Principles of Verifiable RTL Design: A Functional Coding Style Supporting Verification Processes in Verilog is based on the reality that comes from actual large-scale product design process and tool experience.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Data Mining in Finance presents a comprehensive overview of major algorithmic approaches to predictive data mining, including statistical, neural networks, ruled-based, decision-tree, and fuzzy-logic methods, and then examines the suitability of these approaches to financial data mining. The book focuses specifically on relational data mining (RDM), which is a learning method able to learn more expressive rules than other symbolic approaches. RDM is thus better suited for financial mining, because it is able to make greater use of underlying domain knowledge. Relational data mining also has a better ability to explain the discovered rules - an ability critical for avoiding spurious patterns which inevitably arise when the number of variables examined is very large. The earlier algorithms for relational data mining, also known as inductive logic programming (ILP), suffer from a relative computational inefficiency and have rather limited tools for processing numerical data. Data Mining in Finance introduces a new approach, combining relational data mining with the analysis of statistical significance of discovered rules. This reduces the search space and speeds up the algorithms. The book also presents interactive and fuzzy-logic tools for `mining' the knowledge from the experts, further reducing the search space. Data Mining in Finance contains a number of practical examples of forecasting S&amp;P 500, exchange rates, stock directions, and rating stocks for portfolio, allowing interested readers to start building their own models. This book is an excellent reference for researchers and professionals in the fields of artificial intelligence, machine learning, data mining, knowledge discovery, and applied mathematics.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">The Center for Intelligent Information Retrieval (CIIR) was formed in the Computer Science Department ofthe University ofMassachusetts, Amherst in 1992. The core support for the Center came from a National Science Foun- tion State/Industry/University Cooperative Research Center(S/IUCRC) grant, although there had been a sizeable information retrieval (IR) research group for over 10 years prior to that grant. Thebasic goal ofthese Centers is to combine basic research, applied research, and technology transfer. The CIIR has been successful in each of these areas, in that it has produced over 270 research papers, has been involved in many successful government and industry collaborations, and has had a significant role in high-visibility Internet sites and start-ups. As a result of these efforts, the CIIR has become known internationally as one of the leading research groups in the area of information retrieval. The CIIR focuses on research that results in more effective and efficient access and discovery in large, heterogeneous, distributed, text and multimedia databases. The scope of the work that is done in the CIIR is broad and goes significantly beyond “traditional” areas of information retrieval such as retrieval models, cross-lingual search, and automatic query expansion. The research includes both low-level systems issues such as the design of protocols and architectures for distributed search, as well as more human-centered topics such as user interface design, visualization and data mining with text, and multimedia retrieval.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Optical WDM networking technology is spearheading a bandwidth revolution in the networking infrastructure being developed for the next generation Internet. Rapid advances in optical components have enabled the transition from point-to-point WDM links to all-optical networking. Optical WDM Networks: Principles and Practice presents some of the most important challenges facing the optical networking community, along with some suggested solutions. Earlier textbooks in optical networking have a narrower perspective, and rapidly advancing research has created the need for fresh and current information on problems and issues in the field. The volume editors and contributing authors have endeavoured to capture a substantial subset of the key problems and known solutions to these problems. All of the chapters are original contributions from leading international researchers. The chapters address a wide variety of topics, including the state of the art in WDM technology, physical components that make up WDM fiber-optic networks, medium access protocols, wavelength routed networks, optical access networks, network management, and performance evaluation of wavelength routing networks. The chapters also survey critical points in past research and tackle more recent problems. Practitioners and network product engineers interested in current state-of-the-art information beyond textbook-type coverage, and graduate students commencing research in this area, will appreciate the concise - and pertinent - information presented herein.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Middleware Networks: Concept, Design and Deployment of Internet Infrastructure describes a framework for developing IP Service Platforms and emerging managed IP networks with a reference architecture from the AT&amp;T Labs GeoPlex project. The main goal is to present basic principles that both the telecommunications industry and the Internet community can see as providing benefits for service-related network issues. As this is an emerging technology, the solutions presented are timely and significant. Middleware Networks: Concept, Design and Deployment of Internet Infrastructure illustrates the principles of middleware networks, including Application Program Interfaces (APIs), reference architecture, and a model implementation. Part I begins with fundamentals of transport, and quickly transitions to modern transport and technology. Part II elucidates essential requirements and unifying design principles for the Internet. These fundamental principles establish the basis for consistent behavior in view of the explosive growth underway in large-scale heterogeneous networks. Part III demonstrates and explains the resulting architecture and implementation. Particular emphasis is placed upon the control of resources and behavior. Reference is made to open APIs and sample deployments. Middleware Networks: Concept, Design and Deployment of Internet Infrastructure is intended for a technical audience consisting of students, researchers, network professionals, software developers, system architects and technically-oriented managers involved in the definition and deployment of modern Internet platforms or services. Although the book assumes a basic technical competency, as it does not provide remedial essentials, any practitioner will find this useful, particularly those requiring an overview of the newest software architectures in the field.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Information Highways are widely considered as the next generation of high speed communication systems. These highways will be based on emerging Broadband Integrated Services Digital Networks (B-ISDN), which - at least in principle - are envisioned to support not only all the kinds of networking applications known today but also future applications which are not as yet understood fully or even anticipated. Thus, B-ISDNs release networking processes from the limitations which the communications medium has imposed historically. The operational generality stems from the versatility of Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) which is the transfer mode adopted by ITU-T for broadband public ISDN as well as wide area private ISDN. A transfer mode which provides the transmission, multiplexing and switching core that lies at the foundations of a communication network. ATM is designed to integrate existing and future voice, audio, image and data services. Moreover, ATM aims to minimise the complexity of switching and buffer management, to optimise intermediate node processing and buffering and to bound transmission delays. These design objectives are met at high transmission speeds by keeping the basic unit of ATM transmission - the ATM cell - short and of fixed length.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">In our increasingly mobile world the ability to access information on demand at any time and place can satisfy people's information needs as well as confer on them a competitive advantage. The emergence of battery-operated, low-cost and portable computers such as palmtops and PDAs, coupled with the availability and exploitation of wireless networks, have made possible the potential for ubiquitous computing. Through the wireless networks, portable equipments will become an integrated part of existing distributed computing environments, and mobile users can have access to data stored at information servers located at the static portion of the network even while they are on the move. Traditionally, information is retrieved following a request-response model. However, this model is no longer adequate in a wireless computing environment. First, the wireless channel is unreliable and the bandwidth is low compared to the wired counterpart. Second, the environment is essentially asymmetric with a large number of mobile users accessing a small number of servers. Third, battery-operated portable devices can typically operate only for a short time because of the short battery lifespan. Thus, clients are expected to be disconnected most of the time. To overcome these limitations, there has been a proliferation of research efforts on designing data delivery mechanisms to support wireless computing more effectively. Data Dissemination in Wireless Computing Environments focuses on such mechanisms. The purpose is to provide a thorough and comprehensive review of recent advances on energy-efficient data delivery protocols, efficient wireless channel bandwidth utilization, reliable broadcasting and cache invalidation strategies for clients with long disconnection time. Besides surveying existing methods, this book also compares and evaluates some of the more promising schemes.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Robust Speech Recognition in Embedded Systems and PC Applications provides a link between the technology and the application worlds. As speech recognition technology is now good enough for a number of applications and the core technology is well established around hidden Markov models many of the differences between systems found in the field are related to implementation variants. We distinguish between embedded systems and PC-based applications. Embedded applications are usually cost sensitive and require very simple and optimized methods to be viable. Robust Speech Recognition in Embedded Systems and PC Applications reviews the problems of robust speech recognition, summarizes the current state of the art of robust speech recognition while providing some perspectives, and goes over the complementary technologies that are necessary to build an application, such as dialog and user interface technologies. Robust Speech Recognition in Embedded Systems and PC Applications is divided into five chapters. The first one reviews the main difficulties encountered in automatic speech recognition when the type of communication is unknown. The second chapter focuses on environment-independent/adaptive speech recognition approaches and on the mainstream methods applicable to noise robust speech recognition. The third chapter discusses several critical technologies that contribute to making an application usable. It also provides some design recommendations on how to design prompts, generate user feedback and develop speech user interfaces. The fourth chapter reviews several techniques that are particularly useful for embedded systems or to decrease computational complexity. It also presents some case studies for embedded applications and PC-based systems. Finally, the fifth chapter provides a future outlook for robust speech recognition, emphasizing the areas that the author sees as the most promising for the future. Robust Speech Recognition in Embedded Systems and PC Applications serves as a valuable reference and although not intended as a formal University textbook, contains some material that can be used for a course at the graduate or undergraduate level. It is a good complement for the book entitled Robustness in Automatic Speech Recognition: Fundamentals and Applications co-authored by the same author.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Information intermediation is the foundation stone of some of the most successful Internet companies, and is perhaps second only to the Internet Infrastructure companies. On the heels of information integration and interoperability, this book on information brokering discusses the next step in information interoperability and integration. The emerging Internet economy based on burgeoning B2B and B2C trading will soon demand semantics-based information intermediation for its feasibility and success. B2B ventures are involved in the `rationalization' of new vertical markets and construction of domain specific product catalogs. This book provides approaches for re-use of existing vocabularies and domain ontologies as a basis for this rationalization and provides a framework based on inter-ontology interoperation. Infrastructural trade-offs that identify optimizations in performance and scalability of web sites will soon give way to information based trade-offs as alternate rationalization schemes come into play and the necessity of interoperating across these schemes is realized. Information Brokering Across Heterogeneous Digital Data's intended readers are researchers, software architects and CTOs, advanced product developers dealing with information intermediation issues in the context of e-commerce (B2B and B2C), information technology professionals in various vertical markets (e.g., geo-spatial information, medicine, auto), and all librarians interested in information brokering.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Semantic Models for Multimedia Database Searching and Browsing begins with the introduction of multimedia information applications, the need for the development of the multimedia database management systems (MDBMSs), and the important issues and challenges of multimedia systems. The temporal relations, the spatial relations, the spatio-temporal relations, and several semantic models for multimedia information systems are also introduced. In addition, this book discusses recent advances in multimedia database searching and multimedia database browsing. More specifically, issues such as image/video segmentation, motion detection, object tracking, object recognition, knowledge-based event modeling, content-based retrieval, and key frame selections are presented for the first time in a single book. Two case studies consisting of two semantic models are included in the book to illustrate how to use semantic models to design multimedia information systems. Semantic Models for Multimedia Database Searching and Browsing is an excellent reference and can be used in advanced level courses for researchers, scientists, industry professionals, software engineers, students, and general readers who are interested in the issues, challenges, and ideas underlying the current practice of multimedia presentation, multimedia database searching, and multimedia browsing in multimedia information systems.</dcvalue>

Three HDLs are presented: VHDL and Verilog, the widely used standard languages, and the proprietary Altera HDL (AHDL). The chapters on these languages serve as tutorials and comparisons are made that show the strengths and weaknesses of each language. A large number of examples are used in the description of each language providing insight for the design and implementation of FPLDs.  With the addition of the Altera UP-1 prototyping board, all examples can be tested and verified in a real FPLD. Digital Systems Design and Prototyping: Using Field Programmable Logic and Hardware Description Languages, Second Edition is designed as an advanced level textbook as well as a reference for the professional engineer.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Chapter 1 places into perspective a total Information Storage and Retrieval System. This perspective introduces new challenges to the problems that need to be theoretically addressed and commercially implemented. Ten years ago commercial implementation of the algorithms being developed was not realistic, allowing theoreticians to limit their focus to very specific areas. Bounding a problem is still essential in deriving theoretical results. But the commercialization and insertion of this technology into systems like the Internet that are widely being used changes the way problems are bounded. From a theoretical perspective, efficient scalability of algorithms to systems with gigabytes and terabytes of data, operating with minimal user search statement information, and making maximum use of all functional aspects of an information system need to be considered. The dissemination systems using persistent indexes or mail files to modify ranking algorithms and combining the search of structured information fields and free text into a consolidated weighted output are examples of potential new areas of investigation. The best way for the theoretician or the commercial developer to understand the importance of problems to be solved is to place them in the context of a total vision of a complete system. Understanding the differences between Digital Libraries and Information Retrieval Systems will add an additional dimension to the potential future development of systems. The collaborative aspects of digital libraries can be viewed as a new source of information that dynamically could interact with information retrieval techniques.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Mobile Channel Characteristics introduces the principal transmission phenomena of mobile and personal communication - the ones that affect design of modems, channel simulators, smart antennas, and other system components at the physical level. It is designed to be accessible to senior undergraduates, as well as graduate students and working engineers. The treatment parallels mathematical derivations with intuitive explanations and simple approximations in order to develop the reader's understanding of the phenomena. Because of this strong tutorial flavor, the text is also suitable for those entering the area from a different academic discipline. Mobile Channel Characteristics was conceived and written as an interactive text to be viewed on a computer screen. It includes many features not found in conventional texts: The entire text resides on your hard drive. It is always ready, just a mouse-click away; It is a live document. Try different parameter values, and the equations, tables and graphs recalculate as you watch. Animated graphics illustrate dynamics of the channel. Explore propagation, modulation or system models interactively to gain additional insight; The examples and appendices are `tear-off design sheets'. You can use their programs on the job or in your thesis to speed up your work; It links you to the world. Hyperlinks connect you to websites of cited authors, to online research journals, and to employers and graduate schools, all through the Internet. Mobile Channel Characteristics includes working programs for three different methods of channel gain generation for fading channel simulation, as well as working programs to illustrate their use. Mobile Channel Characteristics is an essential reference tool for practising engineers, researchers, academics, and students. It is a self-study text equally suited for classroom use.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Multimedia data comprising of images, audio and video is becoming increasingly common. The decreasing costs of consumer electronic devices such as digital cameras and digital camcorders, along with the ease of transportation facilitated by the Internet, has lead to a phenomenal rise in the amount of multimedia data generated and distributed. Given that this trend of increased use of multimedia data is likely to accelerate, there is an urgent need for providing a clear means of capturing, storing, indexing, retrieving, analyzing and summarizing such data. Content-based access to multimedia data is of primary importance since it is the natural way by which human beings interact with such information. To facilitate the content-based access of multimedia information, the first step is to derive feature measures from these data so that a feature space representation of the data content can be formed. This can subsequently allow for mapping the feature space to the symbol space (semantics) either automatically or through human intervention. Thus, signal to symbol mapping, useful for any practical system, can be successfully achieved. Perspectives on Content-Based Multimedia Systems provides a comprehensive set of techniques to tackle these important issues. This book offers detailed solutions to a wide range of practical problems in building real systems by providing specifics of three systems built by the authors. While providing a systems focus, it also equips the reader with a keen understanding of the fundamental issues, including a formalism for content-based multimedia database systems, multimedia feature extraction, object-based techniques, signature-based techniques and fuzzy retrieval techniques. The performance evaluation issues of practical systems is also explained. This book brings together essential elements of building a content-based multimedia database system in a way that makes them accessible to practitioners in computer science and electrical engineering. It can also serve as a textbook for graduate-level courses.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">The architectural concept of a memory hierarchy has been immensely successful, making possible today's spectacular pace of technology evolution in both the volume of data and the speed of data access. Its success is difficult to understand, however, when examined within the traditional "memoryless" framework of performance analysis. The `memoryless' framework cannot properly reflect a memory hierarchy's ability to take advantage of patterns of data use that are transient. The Fractal Structure of Data Reference: Applications to the Memory Hierarchy both introduces, and justifies empirically, an alternative modeling framework in which arrivals are driven by a statistically self-similar underlying process, and are transient in nature. The substance of this book comes from the ability of the model to impose a mathematically tractable structure on important problems involving the operation and performance of a memory hierarchy. It describes events as they play out at a wide range of time scales, from the operation of file buffers and storage control cache, to a statistical view of entire disk storage applications. Striking insights are obtained about how memory hierarchies work, and how to exploit them to best advantage. The emphasis is on the practical application of such results. The Fractal Structure of Data Reference: Applications to the Memory Hierarchy will be of interest to professionals working in the area of applied computer performance and capacity planning, particularly those with a focus on disk storage. The book is also an excellent reference for those interested in database and data structure research.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">CMOS Memory Circuits is a systematic and comprehensive reference work designed to aid in the understanding of CMOS memory circuits, architectures, and design techniques. CMOS technology is the dominant fabrication method and almost the exclusive choice for semiconductor memory designers. Both the quantity and the variety of complementary-metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) memories are staggering. CMOS memories are traded as mass-products worldwide and are diversified to satisfy nearly all practical requirements in operational speed, power, size, and environmental tolerance. Without the outstanding speed, power, and packing density characteristics of CMOS memories, neither personal computing, nor space exploration, nor superior defense systems, nor many other feats of human ingenuity could be accomplished. Electronic systems need continuous improvements in speed performance, power consumption, packing density, size, weight, and costs. These needs continue to spur the rapid advancement of CMOS memory processing and circuit technologies. CMOS Memory Circuits is essential for those who intend to (1) understand, (2) apply, (3) design and (4) develop CMOS memories.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Coding and Modulation for Digital Television presents a comprehensive description of all error control coding and digital modulation techniques used in Digital Television (DTV). This book illustrates the relevant elements from the expansive theory of channel coding to how the transmission environment dictates the choice of error control coding and digital modulation schemes. These elements are presented in such a way that both the `mathematical integrity' and `understanding for engineers' are combined in a complete form and supported by a number of practical examples. In addition, the book contains descriptions of the existing standards and provides a valuable source of corresponding references. Coding and Modulation for Digital Television also features a description of the latest techniques, providing the reader with a glimpse of future digital broadcasting. These include the concepts of soft-in-soft-out decoding, turbo-coding and cross-correlated quadrature modulation, all of which will have a prominent future in improving efficiency of the next generation DTV systems. Coding and Modulation for Digital Television is essential reading for all undergraduate and postgraduate students, broadcasting and communication engineers, researchers, marketing managers, regulatory bodies, governmental organizations and standardization institutions of the digital television industry.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">“If you have built castles in the air, your work need not be lost; that is where they should be. Now put the foundations under them. ” - Henry David Thoreau, Walden Although engineering is a study entrenched firmly in belief of pr- matism, I have always believed its impact need not be limited to pr- matism. Pragmatism is not the boundaries that define engineering, just the (sometimes unforgiving) rules by which we sight our goals. This book studies two major problems of content-based video proce- ing for a media-based technology: Video Object Plane (VOP) Extr- tion and Representation, in support of the MPEG-4 and MPEG-7 video standards, respectively. After reviewing relevant image and video p- cessing techniques, we introduce the concept of Voronoi Ordered Spaces for both VOP extraction and representation to integrate shape infor- tion into low-level optimization algorithms and to derive robust shape descriptors, respectively. We implement a video object segmentation system with a novel surface optimization scheme that integrates Voronoi Ordered Spaces with existing techniques to balance visual information against predictions of models of a priori information. With these VOPs, we have explicit forms of video objects that give users the ability to - dress and manipulate video content. We outline a general methodology of robust data representation and comparison through the concept of complex partitioning mapped onto Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs).</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">The modern wireless communication industry has put great demands on circuit designers for smaller, cheaper transceivers in the gigahertz frequency range. One tool which has assisted designers in satisfying these requirements is the use of on-chip inductiveelements (inductors and transformers) in silicon (Si) radio-frequency (RF) integrated circuits (ICs). These elements allow greatly improved levels of performance in Si monolithic low-noise amplifiers, power amplifiers, up-conversion and down-conversion mixers and local oscillators. Inductors can be used to improve the intermodulation distortion performance and noise figure of small-signal amplifiers and mixers. In addition, the gain of amplifier stages can be enhanced and the realization of low-cost on-chip local oscillators with good phase noise characteristics is made feasible. In order to reap these benefits, it is essential that the IC designer be able to predict and optimize the characteristics of on-chip inductiveelements. Accurate knowledge of inductance values, quality factor (Q) and the influence of ad- cent elements (on-chip proximity effects) and substrate losses is essential. In this book the analysis, modeling and application of on-chip inductive elements is considered. Using analyses based on Maxwells equations, an accurate and efficient technique is developed to model these elements over a wide frequency range. Energy loss to the conductive substrate is modeled through several mechanisms, including electrically induced displacement and conductive c- rents and by magnetically induced eddy currents. These techniques have been compiled in a user-friendly software tool ASITIC (Analysis and Simulation of Inductors and Transformers for Integrated Circuits).</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">The modern electronic testing has a forty year history. Test professionals hold some fairly large conferences and numerous workshops, have a journal, and there are over one hundred books on testing. Still, a full course on testing is offered only at a few universities, mostly by professors who have a research interest in this area. Apparently, most professors would not have taken a course on electronic testing when they were students. Other than the computer engineering curriculum being too crowded, the major reason cited for the absence of a course on electronic testing is the lack of a suitable textbook. For VLSI the foundation was provided by semiconductor device techn- ogy, circuit design, and electronic testing. In a computer engineering curriculum, therefore, it is necessary that foundations should be taught before applications. The field of VLSI has expanded to systems-on-a-chip, which include digital, memory, and mixed-signalsubsystems. To our knowledge this is the first textbook to cover all three types of electronic circuits. We have written this textbook for an undergraduate “foundations” course on electronic testing. Obviously, it is too voluminous for a one-semester course and a teacher will have to select from the topics. We did not restrict such freedom because the selection may depend upon the individual expertise and interests. Besides, there is merit in having a larger book that will retain its usefulness for the owner even after the completion of the course. With equal tenacity, we address the needs of three other groups of readers.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Karlheinz Brandenburg and Mark Kahrs With the advent of multimedia, digital signal processing (DSP) of sound has emerged from the shadow of bandwidth limited speech processing. Today, the main appli cations of audio DSP are high quality audio coding and the digital generation and manipulation of music signals. They share common research topics including percep tual measurement techniques and analysis/synthesis methods. Smaller but nonetheless very important topics are hearing aids using signal processing technology and hardware architectures for digital signal processing of audio. In all these areas the last decade has seen a significant amount of application oriented research. The topics covered here coincide with the topics covered in the biannual work shop on “Applications of Signal Processing to Audio and Acoustics”. This event is sponsored by the IEEE Signal Processing Society (Technical Committee on Audio and Electroacoustics) and takes place at Mohonk Mountain House in New Paltz, New York. A short overview of each chapter will illustrate the wide variety of technical material presented in the chapters of this book. John Beerends: Perceptual Measurement Techniques. The advent of perceptual measurement techniques is a byproduct of the advent of digital coding for both speech and high quality audio signals. Traditional measurement schemes are bad estimates for the subjective quality after digital coding/decoding. Listening tests are subject to sta tistical uncertainties and the basic question of repeatability in a different environment.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">An exciting new development has taken place in the digital era that has captured the imagination and talent of researchers around the globe - wavelet image compression. This technology has deep roots in theories of vision, and promises performance improvements over all other compression methods, such as those based on Fourier transforms, vectors quantizers, fractals, neural nets, and many others. It is this revolutionary new technology that is presented in Wavelet Image and Video Compression, in a form that is accessible to the largest audience possible. Wavelet Image and Video Compression is divided into four parts. Part I, Background Material, introduces the basic mathematical structures that underly image compression algorithms with the intention of providing an easy introduction to the mathematical concepts that are prerequisites for the remainder of the book. It explains such topics as change of bases, scalar and vector quantization, bit allocation and rate-distortion theory, entropy coding, the discrete-cosine transform, wavelet filters and other related topics. Part II, Still Image Coding, presents a spectrum of wavelet still image coding techniques. Part III, Special Topics in Still Image Coding, provides a variety of example coding schemes with a special flavor in either approach or application domain. Part IV, Video Coding, examines wavelet and pyramidal coding techniques for video data. Wavelet Image and Video Compression serves as an excellent reference and may be used as a text for advanced courses covering the subject.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">The Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM) is undoubtedly the most successful second generation digital mobile radio system. One of the key factors for this exceptional performance is the constant evolution of the GSM systems and its derivatives DCS-1800 and PCS-1900. The objective of the book is to address new concepts in the GSM system, dealing with both standardised features as well as theoretically and technologically feasible improvements, which contribute to evolutionary changes in general. Dynamic evolution of GSM presents a platform for the Universal Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS) introduction and major trends in UMTS development will be addressed in this book, in particular progress towards new radio interface. The book is the collection of individual contributions from a number of authors. The intention of the editors was to gather the most prominent specialist in the GSM area. Ongoing efforts in GSM standardisation are focused on Phase 2+ with items planned to be added gradually on demand. Being mostly independent of each other, each of them could be introduced with little impact on the rest of the system. Speech remains the prime service of cellular systems with ongoing work on spectral efficiency taking into account the trade-off between cost of the system and transmission quality. Most notable result from novel speech service implementations is the introduction of new Enhanced Full Rate (EFR) speech coder. International railway organisation (Union Internationale des Chemins de Fer - UIC) has influenced the development of Advanced Speech Call Items (ASCI).</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Wavelet and subband transforms have been of great interest in the fields of - gineering and applied mathematics. The theories of these powerful signal p- cessing tools have matured and many applications utilizing them are emerging in different disciplines. This book, comprised of eleven chapter contributions from prominent researchers in the field, focuses on communications and mul- media applications of wavelet and subband transforms. The first six chapters of this book deal with a variety of communications applications that significantly benefit from wavelet and subband theories. S- ilarly, the remaining five chapters present recent advances in multimedia - plications of wavelet and subband transforms. These chapters interconnect the requirements of applications with the underlying theory and their engineering solutions. Hence, the reader can easily trace the entire path from fundamentals to the purpose and merit of application in hand. A combined list of references for the entire volume is given at the end of the text that should be helpful to the interested reader for a further study. This book is anticipated to be of particular interest to engineers and sci- tists who want to learn about state-of-the-art subband and wavelet transform applications as well as their theoretical underpinnings. It can also serve as a supplementary book for graduate level engineering and applied mathematics courses on wavelet and subband transforms.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">From a review of the Second Edition 'If you are new to the field and want to know what "all this Verilog stuff is about," you've found the golden goose. The text here is straight forward, complete, and example rich -mega-multi-kudos to the author James Lee. Though not as detailed as the Verilog reference guides from Cadence, it likewise doesn't suffer from the excessive abstractness those make you wade through. This is a quick and easy read, and will serve as a desktop reference for as long as Verilog lives.

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">It is hardly a profound observation to note that we remain in the midst of a wireless revolution. In 1998 alone, over 150 million cell phones were sold worldwide, representing an astonishing 50% increase over the previous year. Maintaining such a remarkable growth rate requires constant innovation to decrease cost while increasing performance and functionality. Traditionally, wireless products have depended on a mixture of semicond- tor technologies, spanning GaAs, bipolar and BiCMOS, just to name a few. A question that has been hotly debated is whether CMOS could ever be suitable for RF applications. However, given the acknowledged inferiority of CMOS transistors relative to those in other candidate technologies, it has been argued by many that “CMOS RF” is an oxymoron, an endeavor best left cloistered in the ivory towers of academia. In rebuttal, there are several compelling reasons to consider CMOS for wi- less applications. Aside from the exponential device and density improvements delivered regularly by Moore’s law, only CMOS offers a technology path for integrating RF and digital elements, potentially leading to exceptionally c- pact and low-cost devices. To enable this achievement, several thorny issues need to be resolved. Among these are the problem of poor passive com- nents, broadband noise in MOSFETs, and phase noise in oscillators made with CMOS. Beyond the component level, there is also the important question of whether there are different architectural choices that one would make if CMOS were used, given the different constraints.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Circuit simulation is essential in integrated circuit design, and the accuracy of circuit simulation depends on the accuracy of the transistor model. BSIM3v3 (BSIM for Berkeley Short-channel IGFET Model) has been selected as the first MOSFET model for standardization by the Compact Model Council, a consortium of leading companies in semiconductor and design tools. In the next few years, many fabless and integrated semiconductor companies are expected to switch from dozens of other MOSFET models to BSIM3. This will require many device engineers and most circuit designers to learn the basics of BSIM3. MOSFET Modeling &amp; BSIM3 User's Guide explains the detailed physical effects that are important in modeling MOSFETs, and presents the derivations of compact model expressions so that users can understand the physical meaning of the model equations and parameters. It is the first book devoted to BSIM3. It treats the BSIM3 model in detail as used in digital, analog and RF circuit design. It covers the complete set of models, i.e., I-V model, capacitance model, noise model, parasitics model, substrate current model, temperature effect model and non quasi-static model. MOSFET Modeling &amp; BSIM3 User's Guide not only addresses the device modeling issues but also provides a user's guide to the device or circuit design engineers who use the BSIM3 model in digital/analog circuit design, RF modeling, statistical modeling, and technology prediction. This book is written for circuit designers and device engineers, as well as device scientists worldwide. It is also suitable as a reference for graduate courses and courses in circuit design or device modelling. Furthermore, it can be used as a textbook for industry courses devoted to BSIM3. MOSFET Modeling &amp; BSIM3 User's Guide is comprehensive and practical. It is balanced between the background information and advanced discussion of BSIM3. It is helpful to experts and students alike.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Rapid Prototyping of Digital Systems provides an exciting and challenging laboratory component for undergraduate digital logic and computer design courses. The more advanced topics and exercises also make this text useful for upper level courses in digital logic or programmable logic. Design engineers working in industry will want to consider this text for a rapid introduction to PPLD technology and logic synthesis using commercial CAD tools. Rapid Prototyping of Digital Systems includes two tutorials on the Altera CAD tool environment, an overview of programmable logic, and a design library with several easy-to-use input and output functions. These features were developed to help students get started quickly. Early design examples use schematic capture and library components. VHDL is used for more complex designs after a short introduction to VHDL-based synthesis. The approach used in this text reflects contemporary practice in industry more accurately than the more traditional TTL protoboard-based laboratory courses. Designs containing up to twenty thousand gates are possible with the Altera Student Version CAD tools and the UP 1 board. Rapid Prototyping of Digital Systems contains a number of interesting and challenging laboratory projects involving serial communications, state machines with video output, video games and graphics, simple computers, keyboard and mouse interfaces, robotics, and a RISC processor core. These projects were all developed on the student version of the Altera CAD tools and can be implemented on the Altera UP 1 board.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Among analog-to-digital converters, the delta-sigma modulator has cornered the market on high to very high resolution converters at moderate speeds, with typical applications such as digital audio and instrumentation. Interest has recently increased in delta-sigma circuits built with a continuous-time loop filter rather than the more common switched-capacitor approach. Continuous-time delta-sigma modulators offer less noisy virtual ground nodes at the input, inherent protection against signal aliasing, and the potential to use a physical rather than an electrical integrator in the first stage for novel applications like accelerometers and magnetic flux sensors. More significantly, they relax settling time restrictions so that modulator clock rates can be raised. This opens the possibility of wideband (1 MHz or more) converters, possibly for use in radio applications at an intermediate frequency so that one or more stages of mixing might be done in the digital domain. Continuous-Time Delta-Sigma Modulators for High-Speed A/D Conversion: Theory, Practice and Fundamental Performance Limits covers all aspects of continuous-time delta-sigma modulator design, with particular emphasis on design for high clock speeds. The authors explain the ideal design of such modulators in terms of the well-understood discrete-time modulator design problem and provide design examples in Matlab. They also cover commonly-encountered non-idealities in continuous-time modulators and how they degrade performance, plus a wealth of material on the main problems (feedback path delays, clock jitter, and quantizer metastability) in very high-speed designs and how to avoid them. They also give a concrete design procedure for a real high-speed circuit which illustrates the tradeoffs in the selection of key parameters. Detailed circuit diagrams, simulation results and test results for an integrated continuous-time 4 GHz band-pass modulator for A/D conversion of 1 GHz analog signals are also presented. Continuous-Time Delta-Sigma Modulators for High-Speed A/D Conversion: Theory, Practice and Fundamental Performance Limits concludes with some promising modulator architectures and a list of the challenges that remain in this exciting field.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">The protection of sensitive information against unauthorized access or fraudulent changes has been of prime concern throughout the centuries. Modern communication techniques, using computers connected through networks, make all data even more vulnerable for these threats. Also, new issues have come up that were not relevant before, e. g. how to add a (digital) signature to an electronic document in such a way that the signer can not deny later on that the document was signed by him/her. Cryptology addresses the above issues. It is at the foundation of all information security. The techniques employed to this end have become increasingly mathematical of nature. This book serves as an introduction to modern cryptographic methods. After a brief survey of classical cryptosystems, it concentrates on three main areas. First of all, stream ciphers and block ciphers are discussed. These systems have extremely fast implementations, but sender and receiver have to share a secret key. Public key cryptosystems (the second main area) make it possible to protect data without a prearranged key. Their security is based on intractable mathematical problems, like the factorization of large numbers. The remaining chapters cover a variety of topics, such as zero-knowledge proofs, secret sharing schemes and authentication codes. Two appendices explain all mathematical prerequisites in great detail. One is on elementary number theory (Euclid's Algorithm, the Chinese Remainder Theorem, quadratic residues, inversion formulas, and continued fractions). The other appendix gives a thorough introduction to finite fields and their algebraic structure.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Design and Analysis of Integrator-Based Log-Domain Filter Circuits deals with the design and analysis of log-domain filter circuits. It describes several synthesis methods that aid the designer in developing bipolar or BiCMOS filter circuits with cut-off frequencies ranging from the low kilohertz range to several hundreds of megahertz. Filter response deviations due to transistor-level nonidealities are systematically analyzed, leading to effective electronic compensation schemes. Numerous examples are provided in the text with measured experimental data from IC prototypes. Design and Analysis of Integrator-Based Log-Domain Filter Circuits is intended for engineers in research or development, as well as advanced-level engineering students. Extensive discussion on filter text metrics should also interest engineers who are responsible for testing high-performance, high-speed analog or mixed-signal products.</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Fluorescence spectroscopy and its applications to the physical and life sciences have evolved rapidly during the past decade. The increased interest in fluorescence appears to be due to advances in time resolution, methods of data analysis, and improved instrumentation. With these advances, it is now practical to perform time-resolved measurements with enough resolution to compare the results with the structural and dynamic features of mac- molecules, to probe the structures of proteins, membranes, and nucleic acids, and to acquire two-dimensional microscopic images of chemical or protein distributions in cell cultures. Advances in laser and detector technology have also resulted in renewed interest in fluorescence for clinical and analytical chemistry. Because of these numerous developments and the rapid appearance of new methods, it has become difficult to remain current on the science of fluorescence and its many applications. Consequently, I have asked the experts in particular areas of fluorescence to summarize their knowledge and the current state of the art. This has resulted in the initial two volumes of Topics in Fluorescence Spectroscopy, which is intended to be an ongoing series which summarizes, in one location, the vast literature on fluorescence spectroscopy. The third volume will appear shortly. The first three volumes are designed to serve as an advanced text. These volumes describe the more recent techniques and technologies (Volume 1), the principles governing fluorescence and the experimental observables (Volume 2), and applications in biochemistry and biophysics (Volume 3).</dcvalue>

 <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" language="en">Time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy is widely used as a research tool in bioch- istry and biophysics. These uses of fluorescence have resulted in extensive knowledge of the structure and dynamics of biological macromolecules. This information has been gained by studies of phenomena that affect the excited state, such as the local environment, quenching processes, and energy transfer. Topics in Fluorescence Spectroscopy, Volume 4: Probe Design and Chemical Sensing reflects a new trend, which is the use of time-resolved fluorescence in analytical and clinical chemistry. These emerging applications of time-resolved fluorescence are the result of continued advances in laser detector and computer technology. For instance, pho- multiplier tubes (PMT) were previously bulky devices. Miniature PMTs are now available, and the performance of simpler detectors is continually improving. There is also considerable effort to develop fluorophores that can be excited with the red/ne- infrared (NIR) output of laser diodes. Using such probes, one can readily imagine small time-resolved fluorometers, even hand-held devices, being used fordoctor’s office or home health care.</dcvalue>
